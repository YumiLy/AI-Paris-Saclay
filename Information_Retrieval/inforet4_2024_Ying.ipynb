Jan 19, 2014 by NATASHA LONGOThis Is What Happens In Your Stomach When You Consume Packaged Ramen Noodles With a Deadly Preservative Ramen noodles contain Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), which is a byproduct of the petroleum industry and food additive frequently to preserve cheap processed foods. It is one of those chemicals that is neither digestible or beneficial in any way for your body. A gastrointestinal specialist conducted an experiment with a time lapse video inside the stomach, comparing both fresh and preserved ramen noodles. After two hours of digestion, the results were staggering. The first-of-its-kind experiment by Dr. Braden Kuo of Massachusetts General Hospital wanted to find out exactly what happens to food in the stomach and digestive tract after consuming ramen noodles. Thanks to the \\\"smart pill,\\\" a camera the size of a multi-vitamin, Dr. Kuo could do his experiment, showing what happens in the gut of someone who ate a package of instant ramen noodles compared to fresh. Dr. Kuo recorded 32 hours from the pill camera. \\\"What we're seeing here is a stomach contracting back and forth as it's trying to grind up the ramen noodles,\\\" Dr. Kuo says of the beginning of the video. For comparison, the study volunteers also ate fresh, homemade ramen noodles on a different day. The video at 20 minutes, and 2 hours, shows a striking difference. \\\"The most striking thing about our experiment when you looked at a time interval, say in one or two hours, we noticed a processed ramen noodles were less broken down that homemade ramen noodles,\\\" noted Dr. Kuo. This affects nutrient absorption and could theoretically allow preservatives to linger longer periods in the stomach cavity before being transported to the intestines and subsequently eliminated. What Is TBHQ? In processed foods, it's sprayed on the food or on its packaging to prevent discoloration and changes to flavor and odor. Others products, such as cosmetics, perfumes, varnishes and lacquers, contain TBHQ to maintain stability. Small amounts of TBHQ may not kill you (although death has occurred) or even make you feel immediately sick, but it can have a long term effect on your health such as weakening of organs and contributing to the onset of cancers and tumors. The FDA says that TBHQ must not exceed 0.02 percent of its oil and fat content. Death has occurred from the ingestion of as little as 5 grams. This would be a considerably high dose compared to the amounts found in foods, but it gives us a good indication on the toxicity level of this preservative. At higher doses, it has some negative health effects on lab animals, such as producing precursors to stomach tumors and damage to DNA. A number of studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high doses of TBHQ may be carcinogenic, especially for stomach tumors. Ingestion of a single gram (a thirtieth of an ounce) has caused nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, diarrhea, ringing in the ears, delirium, a sense of suffocation, and collapse. Some people have reported having anxiety and night terrors and asthma after ingesting TBHQ. Others have reported having a body rash and swollen lymph nodes. You can find TBHQ in Mc Donald\\u2019s chicken Mcnuggets across the United States, however Mcdonalds European chicken nuggets do not contain the toxic preservative. This is interesting since both the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the FDA have evaluated TBHQ and determined that it is safe to consume at the concentration allowed in foods. The EFSA considers TBHQ to be non-carcinogenic, so why do they not allow it in chicken mcnuggets? Other Food Products Containing TBHQ: Mcdonalds chicken nuggets and french fries CHEEZ-IT Crackers made by Kelloggs Butterfinger chocolate and Resee\\u2019s Peanut butter cups Nestle Crunch Wheat Thins Microwave popcorn Pam cooking spray Aldi products Keebler Club crackers Kellogs eggo frozen waffles and many other kellog products Taco bell beans and some taco shells Teddy Grahams Red Barron frozen pizza Keebler Cookies Tasty Kake Little Debbie Kellog\\u2019s Pop-Tarts Homestyle Peanut butter cookies Some forms of soymilk Different breads cerals and crackers could contain TBHQCrisco oil Some pet foods Many cosmetic products and baby products Some hair dyes lipsticks and eyeshadows Wrigley\\u2019s gum Little Debbies nutty bars and some M&M products KFC beans and fried chicken There are many more processed foods not listed above which contain TBHQ. A conclusion that is now quickly reaching vast numbers is that all processed food in general, has far too many problems to be considered safe. Our regulatory agencies are not responsibly catering to the problems and instead of removing these toxins from the food supply, are claiming that safe levels exist. Since when did safe levels exist of any poison entering the body?

So technically, aren't vitamins toxic? Too much sugar can cause diabetes. Toxic. Too much water causes hyponatremia which can be fatal. Toxic. Awareness and moderation in all things. Richard Cheese \\u2022 2 years ago Congratulations. You get the award for idiot of the day. Massive \\u2022 2 years ago They make the point that the dosage is a factor. Vitamin C has no know toxic level, there is a bowel tolerance. I can't imagine a practical way you could kill yourself. The stupid behaviour required to kill yourself through ingestion of water is pretty transparent. The difference is twofold. The real concern is whether the trace amounts of these chemical are harmful. General toxicity may nod in that direction, but they are different issues. Small amounts of vitamin C are great for you, some additives have been found not to be The second issue is what the additive is there for. If a compound is unusual in the human food chain, toxic in some amount, and has no useful purpose post ingestion, why is it in my diet? It may well be useful in some regard, but I would wonder why I am eating it. Vitamin C is not made in the body, is essential to life, has some processing advantages, and is a good thing to eat. Is the difference really so incomprehensible? Another thing about vitamins is they don't change the formula every few years to avoid regulatory oversight. Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago Dude, 5 grams is a (figurative) TON when considering toxicity. Think about medications folks take. Usually in the 0.250 - 0.400 g for anitbiotics (sometimes 1g for single dose treatments) or others: 0.080g for the strongest dose of Oxy Contin, 0.010 g for the strongest dose of Ambien, 0.002 g for the strongest dose of Xanax. 5 g is orders of magnitude greater. And I'm assuming that your 5 g statistic is correct, which after this alarmist piece, I am skeptical. Instant Ramen is not going to kill you. Jesus, people are just looking to find things to be alarmed about and just making stuff up. Read the safety section from the wiki page. This is so a non-story: http://en.wikipedia.org/wik... Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago Yes, and there are also wikipedia pages on the safety levels of lead, mercury, cadmium and many other heavy metals, yet all of them may accumulate in the body in the long-term and none are theoretically safe at any level.

Besides that obesity, IDDM, hyperlipidemia, HTN and so many illness are on the rise is the US. Just looking at baby-boomers alone research shows they are aging faster and are more ill than the generation before. This can not be a coincidence. I believe it's the inclusion of plastics and preservatives into our food culture. All the items are pointing the source, but it takes time to prove. Also, remember in the 50s/60 when data came forth that cigarettes were causing lung cancer (and later other cancers & illness) there were many criticizing its validity, but it ended up being true. Took a significant amount of years to prove the truth. I say it is time we take heed as consumers. We can not wait on an \\\"official publically approved\\\" proof. We have little pieces of evidence here and there that should suffice. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Well come on. We can pretty much all do the math here. People are working longer, have less quality time spent with loved ones and feeling good, don't meditate, don't walk anywhere ever, eat out of paper bags tossed through windows. All that can't possibly lead us to long life and healthy bodies. James Childress \\u2022 3 years ago That ramen in the gut doesn't look like the consumer actually chewed it. Who swallows ramen whole without chewing it up? Failure to chew will slow down the digestion process. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago EXACTLY what I said! Everyone knows digestion begins in the mouth. This must have been a toothless and very hunger booger to have slurped it down unchewed like that. John \\u2022 3 years ago There was a point in my life where all I ate were ramon noodles - morning, noon and night.

Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago I would think the cumulative effect of a lifelong bad diet did you in at only 26, not switching back to Jack in the Box. Yes, let's draw our own conclusions. Danny Bowen \\u2022 4 years ago Since when did safe levels exist of any poison? So are you saying that since water at certain amounts is \\\"toxic\\\" it is a poison, and therefor at any amounts should not be ingested? Did you THINK before you wrote any of this? Katherine Morgan \\u2022 4 years ago And did YOU think before posting such an absurd response... Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago He did and has an excellent point, Katherine. Almost everything will kill you in extreme excess. Not only does the author not mention how much is in a package of Ramen, but he also fails to understand that 5 g is not a little amount in this context. There are tons of things that are perfectly safe at low doses - and this is one of them. Stop looking for boogiemen in everything. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago No amount of any toxin is safe. Anything natural taken in excess can be toxic, however, anything artificial and poisonous is not safe in any amount. It is a sad reality that people justify foods based on their cost or taste, regardless of their toxicity. And when information is presented even in a video that demonstrates that the same preserved food (vs fresh) is not being broken down by the body, people turn a blind eye and attempt to justify why that is so. They then dismiss the information as alarmist rather than taking a step back thinking \\\"hey maybe this chemical shouldn't be in our food supply?\\\" or \\\"why are we eating anything processed that relies on chemical harmful preservatives at all?\\\" Instead, people argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods. It's what we refer to as the sheeple paying tribute and defending those that poison them. Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago I'm sorry, but your first statement is patently false. Our bodies deal with and process \\\"toxins\\\" all the time - take for instance apple seeds, which contain a compound which our bodies break down into cyanide. Cyanide can cause asphyxiation in some doses; however, our bodies are capable of metabolizing small doses of cyanide such that eating an apple core - or even 10 apple cores - don't harm us. Toxicity absolutely depends on dosage; there is no chemical so potent that a single molecule will kill us and there is no chemical so inert that a massive quantity will not kill us. Even water kills at sufficiently high doses by creating an extreme imbalance in your electrolytes. So yes, it is completely relevant to ask how much is in a container of ramen. If what you state were true, there would be no food that would pass such a strict standard. Second issue: there are many things we eat which do not digest. Fiber is one of them. Every time you eat a fruit, there is a large part of that which is indigestible. Any time you eat anything, there is a lot that is not digestible. To be blunt, this is why we defecate. I would agree that it's likely better to eat food that we use more of, assuming we still have a certain level of fiber in our diet. Third, chemicals don't scare me, and I wish they wouldn't scare you so much. Everything you eat contains chemicals. You don't even know what half of them are - scientists don't even know what some of them are. There is no complete catalog of every chemical that is in an apple or a stalk of celery or a haunch of organic beef. We eat these chemicals all the time without a thought, and we misattribute this to it being \\\"natural\\\". I say misattribute, because you are cherry-picking (perhaps literally!). You are ignoring all the natural organisms out there which you don't eat because they'd kill you. The potato plant, other than the root, is poisonous, for example. We've had generations upon generations of trial and error to determine generally what won't kill us in the next 24 hours, but we have almost no research on what might kill us after a lifetime of exposure. Who knows, maybe eating those apple seeds every day will produce early onset dimensia, but no one has thought to even study it. We give a pass to \\\"natural\\\" chemical, yet we jump upon man-made chemicals. That's not dispassionate, scientific thinking. I can assure you; I do not have Stockholm syndrome. I eat organically, when I can, because I do think the abundance of antibiotics and hormones we use are likely not good for the environment. But those beliefs are due to scientific study, not hunches. I don't hold a prejudicial attitude against anything man has made. We've made some pretty darn good things and some pretty crappy, harmful things. How could I immediately praise or write them off without doing any dispassionate scientific study? Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Great comment!T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago I know this is month ago. However, I am wondering if you can answer a general question. Do you think preservatives in our foods are causing inflammation, cancers and other harmful outcomes in the modern human body? Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago\\\"however, anything artificial and poisonous is not safe in any amount. \\\"The 'artificial' bit is utter and complete nonsense!And, a substance is considered 'poisonous', when: the dose is within a certain range that causes harm or death; and/or by a particular route of administration (ROA) that exacerbates harm or hastens death by acting via a different mechanism. If no harm is caused by a particular dose or ROA, then the use of the word 'poisonous' is not justified. Colloquially, we call substances (not required in our diet) that cause harm at very low doses, 'poisons' or 'poisonous'. I get that, hence the confusion for some. Don't be constrained by a definition, especially not a colloquial one. Sodium cyanide (Na CN) is generally considered poisonous, because it causes harm at doses as low as say, 5 to 10 mg (I'm just guessing; don't quote me on this), and we do not require it in our diet; but if we were to ingest say 5 nanograms of Na CN, there would be no harm done and nothing to call 'poisonous'. One final thought. Antioxidants (in relation to food) are considered healthful. You will never guess why TBHQ is added as a preservative? It's an antioxidant. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago What are you talking about? Look at soap. It's made with lye which is caustic but mixed properly, it's the bubbly wonderful stuff we use every day in one way or another. Yes...what Michael Cooney said. James Doe \\u2022 4 years ago Just drink vodka and you'll be fine!Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Amen. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago You seem constrained by your own definition of the word 'poison'. All substances can be considered a 'poison'; the dose, and the route of administration, differentiate poisons from benign substances.brothersun \\u2022 3 years ago Maybe the stomach is contracting to try to grind up the pill-cam! Need a control group with no pill-cam to be sure. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago...but without the pill-cam we couldn't see...the pill-cam. LOL!Sweetvegan \\u2022 3 years ago This was not an experiment involving TBHQ. This was an experiment comparing processed v. fresh ramen noodles. David Wierda \\u2022 3 years ago\\\"Aldi products\\\" All of them? Are you serious? Guest \\u2022 3 years ago Richard Cheese \\u2022 2 years ago WTF? Take your nonsene elsewhere idiot. Mike84 \\u2022 2 years ago Right on, I lost 30 pounds in 30 days as well eating Mc Donalds or Taco Bell almost daily. I didn't even buy the \\\"healthy\\\" stuff. I was eating double cheeseburgers, fries, quesaritos, etc. It's all about your total daily intake. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Yes, it mostly is due to your daily caloric intake. Bryan Van Wagner \\u2022 3 years ago Life is fatal. Karen Sherry Brackett \\u2022 4 years ago Good article and interesting list of products containing this chemical. It is in the noodles. Besides making them rubbery it also raises their melting point which increases shelf life but also makes it hard to digest them and harder still ...to get any actual food nutrients from them. A person might as well eat a football. To put this in perspective butyl groups are used in everything from rubber tires to footballs. lol What's worse is their parent base for the chemical is hydroquinone. Here's a warning from the MSDS. Toxicity to Animals: Acute oral toxicity (LD50): 320 mg/kg [Rat.]. Acute dermal toxicity (LD50): 5970 mg/kg [Mammal]. Chronic Effects on Humans: The substance is toxic to lungs, the nervous system, mucous membranes. Karen Sherry Brackett \\u2022 4 years ago To put the MSDS for hydroquinone into perspective.... basically a 160 pound person would need to eat only ounces of 4-butylhydroquinone to reach acute toxicity at which point damage to their lungs and nervous system will start to be exhibited in a pronounced way. So, if barely half a pound taken all at once will produce acute toxicity damage then every exposure less than that will be causing damage as well only to a degree not physically noticeable as a symptom but with the potential to accumulate to the same level of symptom if not worse degrees of damage. So, while the content per package is very small because it is in use in so many products the over all exposure to this chemical is likely to be high and consequently a severe health hazard. This chemical really needs to be banned from all food products in my opinion. Also, keep in that this determination is only based on the parent molecule for hydroquinone and does not even take into account the health effects of the additional four butyl groups to the human body. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago First, 4-butylhydroquinone is NOT the same as t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), so do not get them confused. Second, the potential to accumulate in the system is not possible as it is not stored but excreted, just like most things. You would rupture your digestive system long before you could get to a toxic level before you excreted it. You would have to ingest 5 kilograms of foods to have ingested 1 gram of TBHQ. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 3 years ago Ok, we're clearly coming from different angles Nicholas. We don't share your perspective, but thanks for your feedback. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago Again, why argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods. That's like ordering a pizza and spreading a little bit of drano plumbing powder because it tastes good, but lets not put too much because it's toxic at higher levels. It's a very illogical argument. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago There are toxins in everything. Just breathing introduces toxins into the body. Organically grown foods have toxins, but you do not recommend that we not eat these foods. The normal human body can and does handle these toxins (both natural and man made) with little or no problem. The TBHQ is used as a food preservative in many foods including butter. Without it the foods would not have the ability to be stored, and without that ability these foods would not be available to the majority of people. Not everyone has a cow. Yes freshly made noodles are easier to digest and may be healthier, they are also MUCH more expensive per serving and take time that is not always available for food preparation. T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago I think it is about knowledge. If you choose to eat food knowing that it contains harmful items that were not meant to be digested by the body it is your choice. However, it is important that the public has knowledge to make such a choice also. Massive \\u2022 2 years ago Call BS on that. Making your own noodles is far cheaper. Making your own bread pays for the breadmaker in s a few weeks. and noodle makers that used to cost hundreds are pretty cheap also. People don't want to take the time, which is trivial once the routine is down, but they spend the time making the money and shopping. The problem is that the people who get into this stuff want to make flax kumquat bread, etc... And it takes a while to perfect a recipe so they loose interest. There isn't that much interest in using the machines to make a cheap normal bread because that isn't the magic most people are looking for. But is it healthier, fast, and cheaper? Sure. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 3 years ago Of course the human body will handle toxins but the point is, you have hundreds of other choices aside from ramen noodles which do not have this preservative. Any toxins you may consider organically grown foods to contain are grown from the Earth and those can be handled effectively by bodily absorption, distribution, and metabolism whereas many of these type of toxins accumulate in the body and are not as easily metabolized or assimilated. THBQ is not in organic butter. You can make all the excuses in the world to consume preservatives, but in the end that's all they are, excuses because you always have a choice to eat healthier and consume fresh wholesome foods than those which are processed. You always have a choice. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago Yes, the choice is there. Organic butter does not have THBQ. It also does not have a shelf life that makes it marketable except locally. And it does have a higher cost to the consumer. And while many toxins accumulate in the body and are dangerous, THBQ is not one of them. There are many reasons to not consume almost all of the foods that contain THBQ, but the toxicity is a very minor one. Rather you should limit or refrain consumption because of the high fat content of the chicken nuggets and butter, or the EXTREME sodium levels in the ramen flavour packet. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Yes but organic also costs a fortune AND I don't even trust that the little sticker on a supposed organic tomato means anything so I can't justify the cost. How many times has it been revealed that lower level products have been sold masquerading as a more expensive version or brand? It's a shame, though, really that even eating well is a luxury for some. I would have to quadruple my current food budget just to do whatever I could to buy better. I love, love, love fresh veggies and salads, fruits and the whole bit but I have more to do with my money than buy food. Bill De Lozier \\u2022 4 years agoyes , i agree. romans used lead for plumbing and decided wine tastes better in lead vessels. small doses over time are as debilitating as one large dose. the wealthy in ancient Rome became poisened over time and also sterile. their children died young as well. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Everything is toxic or poisonous -- or it is not -- it all depends on the dose and route of administration (ROA). \\\"why argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods\\\"Because at certain doses (and ROAs) these substances ARE NOT TOXINS. Drano is for drains, it was never meant for consumption, furthermore Drano is a mixture of several substances listed below for the crystal formulation:1. sodium hydroxide (aka lye or caustic soda),2. sodium nitrate,3. sodium chloride,4. aluminum (as metal flakes)Number 1 is used to make German pretzels, it's also used to remove a nasty tasting compound from unripe olives (green olives). It's also used to make soap, especially homemade soap. I wonder if green olives are good on pizza? Number 2 is used to cure country hams. A bit of country ham on a pizza might be delicious. I'll keep my eye out for the next Tombstone limited-time speciality pizza with country ham. Yum. Number 3 is found extensively in pizza. It's table salt. Number 4 is used to make aluminum-foil, cookware (pots, pans, cookie sheets, 1/2 and full-sized restaurant style sheet pans, etc.) I use a 1/2 sheet pan lined with aluminum foil to bake my Tombstone pizzas on. Of those substances, sodium hydroxide is the most poisonous, no, actually it's corrosive. Trace amounts in your soap may dry out your skin faster. Trace amounts in pretzels or green olives are not an issue because at those levels (doses) they cause no harm whatsoever. Obviously, a large dose will dissolve your skin or tissue of your esophagus. That's why it's used to clear drains. It breaks down hair, and dead skin. When you make soap, you use sodium hydroxide to convert fat into soap (a fatty acid sodium salt) and glycerine, which can now dissolve in water. It does the same thing to grease in your drain. One can use aluminum cookware with few issues, but if you were to swallow many aluminum metal flakes, they might tear up your digestive tract, or pass through without issue, or cause aluminum poisoning, but it depend on how much you swallowed. Sodium nitrate is probably the most poisonous but only at very high doses. What's left in a country ham causes no harm. It would appear much of Drano is already on, or in, or involved with your pizza. But only a total f*cking idiot would put Drano on his pizza. That would be much too high a dose of FOUR different substances, that when combined with water, create heat and react chemically to unclog drains. I would not want that happening in my stomach, but to continue your Drano analogy, lets say I measure out 1 micro gram of a Drano crystal and swallowed it. Would I die, get sick, or be harmed? Nope. The dose it too low. If this analogy is still insufficient to allow people to comprehend what I originally wrote above, and repeated below...\\\"Everything is toxic or poisonous -- or it is not -- it all depends on the dose and route of administration (ROA). \\\"...then I am at a loss for a better way to explain it. Perhaps my analogue actually sucks; but I must also entertain the slight possibility, that this may be incomprehensible to a few select people. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Hydroquinone is not the same substance as TBHQ. But let's go with your example anyways. 160 lbs / 2.2 kg/lbs = 72.7 kg. 5970 mg/kg x 72.7 kg = 434,019 mg 434,019 mg / 1000 mg/g = 434 g434 g = 15. 3 oz (I Googled it) Your mammals would have to eat just under a pound of hydroquinone before half of them would die. That seems pretty darned safe to me. Your calculation was a bit off but you were in the ballpark. It's odd you said \\\"'barely' half a pound taken at once\\\" Is not a half of a pound a lot of hydroquinone? This is not the amount of food you would have to eat, but the amount of pure hydroquinone you would have to eat. Now ask how much food you would need to eat as a test mammal to consume 15.3 oz of pure hydroquinone? IDK, cause it's not the substance in question, but I'll bet it is lots.

The series follows the life of Melinda Gordon ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ), who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. While trying to live as normal a life as possible\\u2014she is married and owns an antique store\\u2014Melinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the Light, or the spirit world. Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and disbelieve her ability. In addition, the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing in the beginning and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirit's needs and help them. [1]Ghost Whisperer ' s fifth and final season aired in the United States (U. S.) on Fridays at 8:00 pm ET on CBS, a terrestrial television network, followed by the sixth season of Medium, where it received an average of 7.78 million viewers per episode, becoming the least watched season of the series. [2] It receives around 200,000 viewers per episode in New Zealand, and is constantly rated in the top 5 for TV2 every Monday. Contents1 Plot2 Development3 Syndication4 Cancellation5 Cast6 Episodes7 References Plot [ edit]In the fifth season, five years have elapsed since the events of the previous season, and we are introduced to Jim and Melinda's son, Aiden Lucas. We learn that he can see the \\\"Shinies and the Shadows\\\", two opposing groups of ghosts that Melinda is unable to see. The Shadows are revealed to be the negative part of spirits that get left behind when they cross over, and their motives involve acquiring the Book of Changes. Melinda, Ned, and Eli, with the frequent help of Delia, work to keep the book safe from the Shadows. Throughout the season, Melinda struggles to keep Aiden safe and help him with his gift. He has frequent run-ins with the Shinies, who are presumed to be the kind group of spirits and are attracted to shiny objects. The Shadows show tremendous power throughout the season, forcing President Bedford, the president of Rockland University to blow up Delia's real estate office. At the end of the series, Melinda and Jim try to protect Aiden by convincing him that ghosts don't exist (at the advice of Carl the Watcher, later revealed to be under the influence of the Shadows). The Shadows gradually begin to take possession of Melinda's body. Aiden is told by Carl that he must go to Melinda's store. Jim, Ned, Eli and Delia follow with him. Melinda is inside, being engulfed by the Shadows. Aiden, who has forged a friendship with one of the Shinies (previously revealed to be the ghosts of children), enlists their help. In the town square, dozens of Shinies gather, and emit a bright light. The Shinies and their light become visible to passersby in the square. Inside the store, the Shadows are trying to battle the light and fully possess Melinda, but fail on both accounts. Melinda drops to the ground and the group run in. Later that night, Aiden is in his room and Melinda and Jim enter. Melinda tells him that they should both be proud of their gift and that he was her hero that night. Aiden replies that Melinda is a hero every day, and the series closes with a shot of Melinda smiling and tearing up. Development [ edit]Ghost Whisperer is based on the work of \\\"Spirit Communicator\\\" James Van Praagh, [3] who is co- executive producer [4] and regularly updates a blog about the show through Living TV. [5] The stories are also said to be based in part on the work of \\\"Spirit Communicator\\\" Mary Ann Winkowski. [6] Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere. [7]The show was produced by Sander/Moses Productions in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television in season one and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons) and CBS Paramount Network Television in seasons two and three). The show was filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles. [8] One area on the lot is Courthouse Square from the Back to the Future trilogy, though it has been drastically modified to depict Grandview. For example, the clock tower in Back to the Future has been completely covered up. Cast and crew members believe that the set gets visits from real spirits. [9]Sound effects were completed at Smart Post Sound. [10] Visual effects for the pilot and some season one episodes were completed at Flash Film Works. [11] Visual effects for nearly the entire series were created at Eden FX. [12]Creator John Gray grew up in Brooklyn, New York, which is not far from Grandview-On-Hudson, west of the Hudson River. Piermont is often referenced in episodes as the neighboring town, which is accurate to real life as Grandview-On-Hudson is actually located just north of Piermont. Professor Rick Payne worked in the fictional \\\"Rockland University\\\", and perhaps not coincidentally, the actual Grandview, New York is a village located in Rockland County, New York. Syndication [ edit]On May 5, 2008 it was announced that the first three seasons of Ghost Whisperer were purchased for $169.8 million ($700,000 per episode, per network) for syndication by Sy Fy, ION Television, and WE TV. Episodes began airing in Summer 2009 on ION, and in Fall 2009 on Sy Fy and WE. [13] The first four seasons began airing in syndication on CBC Television in Canada on August 31, 2009. [14]Cancellation [ edit]On May 18, 2010, citing rising costs and a decline in viewership, CBS announced that Ghost Whisperer would not be renewed for another season. [15] On May 18, 2010, CBS cancelled the show after five seasons. [16] ABC expressed interest in picking up Ghost Whisperer for Fall 2010. [17] [18] It was revealed on May 19, that writers of the show were informed to not look for other jobs yet, and the producers were very optimistic that there was a good chance of Ghost Whisperer being renewed by ABC. [19] On May 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello reported that ABC had passed on renewing Ghost Whisperer for its sixth season. [20]Zap2it declared Ghost Whisperer is the second \\\"most missed axed show\\\" after a poll determined 17.1 percent of voters would miss it. [21] In October 2010, Jennifer Love Hewitt thanked the fans of the show for their support in a goodbye video (filmed in June, 2010), saying \\\"Your love and support has meant everything to the cast and crew of Ghost Whisperer and we will all miss you guys very, very much.

Melinda gets completely taken over by the shadows, and when Carl sees Aiden talking to someone he can't see, Aiden reveals that it's a shiny- or the crossed over ghost of a child.

Killer whale Takara gave birth to her calf at the park in San Antonio, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon. Vets have not yet determined the gender of the calf, but said both mother and baby are in good shape and being monitored closely. Sea World Entertainment Inc popularised killer whale shows in the 1960s but faced growing opposition in recent years.

Takara was already pregnant when the company announced last year that it was suspending its captive breeding programme. Takara swam around the tank as she gave birth (Image: REUTERS)It also vowed to phase out killer whale shows at its three parks in Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California and San Antonio. \\\"This is the last one, and that makes this a particularly big deal,\\\" Sea World Chief Zoological Officer Chris Dold said. \\\"It is a bit bitter sweet. We love these killer whales. \\\"The calf is finally born (Image: REUTERS)The calf was born after an 18-month pregnancy and is estimated to weigh between 300 and 350 pounds and measure between 6 and 7 feet, Sea World said.

There have been various slide-to-unlock methods and OEMs have always put their own spin on things. As it turns out, there are also a lot of lock screen apps in the Play Store that can do even more. They\\u2019re not as popular as they used to be. However, many people still enjoy the allure of a new lock screen. These days, we usually recommend people just use a finger print scanner to bypass the lock screen altogether. It\\u2019s okay if you don\\u2019t want to do that, though. Here are the best lock screen apps for Android!Here are some more excellent customization apps!15 best Android launcher apps of 201710 best Android themes Ac Display Price: Free / $1-$80DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAc Display is one of the most popular lock screen apps. It emulates the always-on lock screens of devices like the Moto X, Galaxy S8, and others. Users can play with notifications without unlocking their display. It also features some customizations. For instance, you can set it to work only during certain hours to save battery life. More and more devices are coming stock with something similar. Thus, we'd only recommend Ac Display to those with older devices that don't already have this feature. Its last update was in 2015. We're not sure if the developer is doing much with it anymore. At the very least, it's free to download and play with. Alarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAlarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock is an older app. However, its features are still very relevant today. It focuses more on security than anything else. Instead of being ridiculously secure, the app is ridiculously annoying. Someone putting in the wrong passcode will make your phone sound off very loud alarms. It'll also vibrate, blink the screen, and cause a general ruckus. In other words, you will know if someone is getting into your phone. It's one of the few free lock screen apps. Just don't mess up your passcode. Seriously. CM Locker Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMost of Cheetah Mobile's apps are trash. This one isn't so bad. It's a lock screen app and applock hybrid. It features the usual array of security precautions along with the ability to lock apps as needed. That way even if hackers get through the lock screen, they still can't easily get into your apps. The app also features HD wallpapers, notification support, a news feed, and intruder selfies. There are some advertisements. They may or may not bother you depending on your tolerance for such things. It is otherwise free with no in-app purchases. Dash Clock Widget Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYDash Clock Widget isn't technically a lock screen app. It's actually a lock screen widget. However, it still works for a list like this. It delivers the basic stats like time, weather, and some notifications. There are extensions available that increase the number of things you can do. It's actually more effective than most lock screen apps. However, it's only available on devices running Android 4.2-4.4. The number of people with devices running that gets smaller every year. It's still perfectly usable as a home screen widget, though!Echo Notification Lock Screen Price: Free / Up to $4.49DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYEcho Notification is one of those lock screen apps that focuses on notifications. It'll pop them up on your lock screen as you receive them. It's not too different from what we have now in the stock lock screens. However, it's still a fresh take on the idea. The app itself is minimal and easy to use. You can also group notifications into categories like social, work, etc. It also has additional customization features. It's free to try and you can unlock the pro version as an in-app purchase. Here are some more related and recommended app lists!10 best security apps for Android that aren\\u2019t antivirus apps10 best icon packs for Android (by developer)GO Locker Price: Free / $14.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYGO Locker is among the most popular lock screen apps.

It's not the most unique lockscreen replacement app. It's really good for theming, though. Hi Locker Price: Free / $1.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYHi Locker is a fairly typical lock screen replacement app. It'll show you the basics such as weather, notifications, calendar events, etc. You can also have it greet you with funny quips and greetings. It even has fingerprint support on devices with fingerprint readers. You can also have it auto-set wallpapers from Flickr. There are some customization options as well. For instance, you can have it hide notifications from certain apps so people can't see it. It's not even close to the most complicated lock screen apps, but it's a great replacement for those who don't need a ton of features. Lok Lok Price: Free with in-app purchases DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYLok Lok is different from most lock screen apps. It's almost kind of a mash-up of a lock screen and Snapchat. Turning on the device will open your camera. You can take a picture, draw on that picture, and then send it to your friends or loved ones. They'll see the image when they unlock their phone next and can respond accordingly. It's not great for sending risque pictures, but it's excellent for reminding someone to grab milk on their way home from work. The app is free to use. There are in-app purchases for things like sticker packs. Next Lock Screen Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYNext Lock Screen is Microsoft's foray into the lock screen apps space. It bills itself as a lock screen for professionals. It features the usual fair like notifications, custom unlock methods, calendar appointments, and weather. You can also do things like call contacts, launch apps, access tools (flashlight, camera), and even change the wallpaper. It's essentially a whole home screen on your lock screen. It's not the most secure lock screen out there. However, it's really good for people who have lots of stuff to do. Picturesque Lock Screen Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMicrosoft actually released two lock screen apps. This one is called Picturesque. This one boasts an ever-revolving lock screen wallpaper. It grabs backgrounds from Bing similar to Windows 10 lock screens. There are some other features as well. They include a search bar, various tools like camera and flashlight, and it's compatible with Bing Rewards. Many of its features cater specifically to Indian audiences. However, those not in India can just turn those features off. Only five more apps to go!

It'll also log every unsuccessful attempt so you can see what time it happened. The app also shows you the weather, has a quick launch bar with up to five apps, and more. It isn't the most customizable lock screen. It will definitely show you who's been trying to peep at your info. Smart Lock Screen apps Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYSmart Lock Screen is the name of a developer on Google Play. As you may have guessed, the developer makes lock screen apps. They're actually fairly simple. They consist of a PIN lock with a variety of themes behind them. The animations are nice, but otherwise it's just a simple lock screen.

Do you know anyone who has a well-defined sense of what their values and goals are in life and are highly committed to making them happen? If so, you that person has reached identity achievement. Learn more about identity achievement from this lesson and test your knowledge with a quiz. James Marcia and Identity James Marcia is a Canadian developmental psychologist who is known for his theory of identity development. Following up on Erik Erikson's concepts of identity crisis and identity confusion, Marcia believes that there are 4 processes that adolescents can go through as they develop their identity. Marcia called these processes identity statuses. An adolescent's identity status depends on two conditions: If the adolescent is actively searching for, or exploring, their identity, and if the adolescent is dedicated to, or made a commitment to, any personal values or beliefs. Marcia's four identity statuses are: Identity Diffusion: Adolescents have not yet attempted to find their identity, nor do they have a clear picture of what their identity may be. They have not set any goals for themselves. Identity diffusion is characterized by low commitment and low exploration. Identity Foreclosure: Adolescents have blindly accepted and committed to values and beliefs taught to them by their family, community, or significant others without exploring alternatives. They do not question the values that were taught to them. Identity foreclosure is characterized by high commitment and low exploration. Identity Moratorium: Adolescents are actively experiencing a crisis which has led them to explore their identity and values. However, they have not yet committed to any values or beliefs and are instead experimenting. Identity moratorium is characterized by low commitment and high exploration. Identity Achievement: After a process of active exploration, adolescents have made a strong commitment to a highly developed set of beliefs and values. Identity achievement is characterized by high commitment and high exploration. These four statuses are not sequential. For example, an adolescent may begin at the identity diffusion status and jump right into identity achievement. Though all adolescents will eventually experience at least one of the four identity statuses, they do not have to go through all four statuses. So what does identity achievement in adolescence look like? Example of Identity Achievement Adolescents at the identity achievement stage have actively explored and examined different values and beliefs and have finally chosen those that are most important to them. They are able to sort out who they want to be and what their life's purpose is. They realize what their priorities are. These adolescents are also confident and positive that they chose the right values and beliefs. Let's take Sally, for example. Sally's parents and grandparents are both medical doctors, and as college students they all went to the same medical school. Ever since she can remember, Sally's parents have always told her that she was going to be a surgeon. Although Sally thought the world of her parents, she did not think that she wanted to spend all of her time caring for sick people. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.

Process of diffusion where molecules diffuse across membrane with the assistance of carrier proteins Movement of substrate down its concentration gradient Energy comes from the concentration gradient of the solute Passive Because not continual passage and a finite amount of transporters, the system will saturate eventually when soluble molecules exceed transporter molecules What are carrier proteins? They aid in the movement of polar molecules across the cell membrane What is active transport? Mechanism to move selected molecules across cell membranes, against their concentration gradient Substrate binds to protein carrier that changes conformation to move substrate across the membrane Active (requires energy from ATP hydrolysis like ATPase which is a Na+/K+ pump)Why does active transport require energy? Going against the concentration gradient What is secondary active transport? When a substance is carried up its concentration gradient without ATP catabolism Kinetic energy of movement of one substance down its concentration gradient powers the simultaneous transport of another up its concentration gradient It rides on the 'coat-tails' of primary active transport and do not themselves require ATPSequential binding of a substrate and ions to specific sites in the transport protein induces a conformational change in the protein Powered by the chemical energy in the ion diffusing down its concentration gradient and this energy is used to 'push' some solutes against its concentration gradient What powers secondary active transport? The chemical energy in the ion diffusing down its concentration gradient and this energy is used to 'push' some solutes against its concentration gradient What are poor loops in channels? Molecules that dangle inside the channel They give physical properties for specific and selectivity filtering These 'pores' are called membrane channels What are gated channels? Holes in the membrane that can be opened or closed What are ligand gated channels? Binding of chemical agents Cell membrane receptors are part of the body's chemical signaling system The binding of a receptor with its ligand usually triggers events at the membrane such as activation of an enzyme What are voltage gated channels? Voltage across the membrane Membrane channels that are sensitive to potential difference across the membrane where changes the conformation of the channel subunits causing a diffusion pore to be created Do all cells generate a membrane potential? Yes where inside is more negative than outside usually All cells poses a non-zero membrane potential What is the S4 protein in the voltage gated channel Voltage sensing mechanism. The 4th transmembrane domain of the protein. Are positively charged Stick out the side of the protein Natural position of the S4 is up towards outer surface of the cell membrane but when membrane is polarized, positively charged S4 is attracted downwards to the negatively charged inner surface of the membrane, shutting the game. When depolarized, the membrane at ~-50m V, no lover provides sufficient electrical attraction to hold S4 downwards, it will migrate back up causing the pore to open allowing ions to diffuse through What is endocytosis? Inward 'pinching' of membrane to create a vesicle Usually receptor-mediated to capture proteins, from outside to inside What is exocytosis? Partial or complete fusion of vesicles with cell membrane for bulk trans-membrane transport of specific molecules, from inside to outside There are two types:1) Exocytosis 1: The more rapid mechanism is dubbed the 'Kiss and Run'2) Exocytosis 2: Full exocytosis What is exocytosis 1? Kiss and Run The secretory vesicles dock and fuse with the plasma membrane at specific locations called 'fusion pores'Happens in a transient matter Vesicle can connect and disconnect several times before contents are emptied Generally, only part of the vesicle contents diffuse into the interstital fluid, used for low rate of signaling What is exocytosis 2? Full exocytosis This involves complete fusion of the vesicle with the membrane, leading to total release of vesicle contents at once Necessary for delivery of membrane proteins and high levels of signaling Must be counterbalanced by endocytosis to stabilize the membrane surface area What are the two conditions to generate membrane potential (MP)?1) Create a concnetration gradient: an enzyme ion pump (functions as an ATPase) must actively transport certain ion species across the membrane to create a concentration gradient2) Semi-permeable membrane: allows one ion species to diffuse across the membrane more than others Diffusion of that ion species down its concentration gradient creates an electrical gradient What is the Na+/K+ pump? All cell membrane is loaded with Na+/K+ pumps, that is the staple of all living cells Na+, K+ - dependent ATPase is enzyme that moves Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell by breaking down ATPFor each ATP molecule broken down, 3 Na+ ions are pumped out and 2 K+ pumped in to create a concentration gradient Consumes 1/3 of energy needs of body Na/K inequality greater potential difference of -10m V because both are cations and as this pumping process occurs, the inside becomes more negative Is our resting Mp roughly -10m V? No, the actual resting MP in neurons is closer to -70m VExplain resting membrane potential Since our resting MP is closer to -70m V, this is due to diffusion of K+ ions outwards The 'resting' membrane is most permeable to K+ ions K+ diffuse out of the cell, down the concentration gradient via K+ channels while Na will do nothing so the membrane potential will slowly keep going down Cations accumulate on the outside of the membrane, leaving a net negativity inside membrane This efflux will occur until there is a such a build up of \\\"+\\\" charge on the outside of the membrane that further diffusion of K+ is repelled by the electromagnetic force (causing a reach of equilibrium)Explain K+ channels There are 2 pores within the structure through which only K ions can pass There will be K+ leakage at all times What is Nernest equation? Can be used to calculate the equilibrium potential Describes the balance between the chemical work of diffusion with electrical work of repulsion The equation gives the potential difference across the membrane, inside with respect to outside, at equilibrium The result is valid if and only if one ion species is diffusion across the membrane Explain Na+ equilibrium potential Under certain circumstances, permeability of Na+ can be dominant and much more than the K+ ion and MP can change drastically If membrane properties change to make the membrane most permeable to Na+, then there is a net Na+ current inward Membrane potential is positive inside with respect to outside: ENa+ = +60m VIn the sense of membrane potential, what is the purpose of Cl- ions? Inside the cell, we have large proteins (which are basically trapped, they can only get across the outside using exocitosis) and since they tend to have \\\"-\\\" charges, the Cl- ion is pushed out of the cell Therefore, the Cl- ions tend to be more concentrated on the outside in the extracellular space This is due to anion proteins present on the inside and not due to active pump You will find more Cl- on the outside and less on the inside Explain Na+ channels To generate a signal, membrane increases its conductance by opening a channel permeable only to Na+ ions This is a voltage-gated Na+ channel In normal resting MP, this Na+ channel is shut To open this Na+ channel, we need to depolarize (removing the polarization) the membrane by a certain amount (from about -70m V to ~-55m V)Na+ channel only opened by depolarizing the membrane to a threshold potential of about -55m VTheoretically, Na+ channels cannot go above +60m V but before getting to that, at about +30m V, the inactivation gate closes (and it will stayed closed unless it goes below -55m V to be reactivated agai n)What is action potential? AP is essentially an impulse, a very short lived change in the MP, an AP is used as a signal (like a flux)You can only produce an AP in membrane that contains the voltage-gated Na+ channels By definition, the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channel make the membrane 'excitable'Na+ inactivation leaves K+ leakage as main current, and resting potential is restored (when between -55 and -70, K is dominant but when above -55, Na will be dominant)Fill in this chart:1) Resting membrane potential2) Depolarizing stimulus3) Membrane depolarizes to threshold. Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels begin to open4) Rapid Na+ entry depolarizes cell5) Na+ channels close and slower K+ channels open6) K+ moves from cell to extracellular fluid7) K+ channels remain open and additional K+ leaves cell, hyperpolarizing it8) Voltage-gated K+ channels close, less K+ leaks out of cell9) Cell returns to resting ion permeability and resting membrane potential What causes blimps in action potential? A depolarizing below threshold (a subthreshold)Define threshold in the aspect of action potential Minimum depolarization necessary to induce the regenerative mechanism for opening of Na+ channels At what voltage starts an action potential?-55m VWhat is supra-threshold and what does it cause? Huge jump in voltage and cause an action potential Action potential from threshold and supra-threshold stimulus have the same magnitude How is information from a stimulus intensity coded? By changes in the frequency of the action potential (frequency coding)What are refractory periods (RP)? After we generate an AP and inactive the Na+ channels, we have a period in which all or some Na+ channels are inactivated Na+ channels remain inactivated until membrane potential drops below 'threshold', then channels reconfigure to their original state and membrane becomes excitable again There are two types of RP: Absolute and Relative Absolute RP is none of the channels are reconfigured. When a channel is inactivated, you cannot fire an action potential Relative RP: Some but not all of the channels are reconfigured. You can actually generate a smaller action potential during the relative RPHow can you completely block the membrane from producing an AP? By keeping the membrane depolarized using an depolarization block. If you permanently depolarize the membrane, you keep it at 20m V (above threshold), the Na+ channels will be permanently inactivated and you will not be able to generate another APHow can you keep the membrane depolarized? By destroying the concentration gradient for K+ by introducing more K+ in the extracellular space (example: KCl injection)This will result in permanent Na+ inactivation and the membrane will remain in absolute refractory state and the membrane becomes in-excitable What is after-hyperpolarization? Due to the presence of this \\\"extra\\\" K+ channels, in conjunction with the leakage of K+ channels, we have much greater outward K+ current This results in the MP to be more polarized than normal Thus, the voltage-gated K+ channels cause hyperpolarization after the APSo instead of the MP being repolarized to -70m V, the MP might be repolarized to -80m VWhat is impulse conduction? When a patch of excitable membrane generates an action potential, this causes an influx of Na+ and reverses the potential difference across the membrane The local reversal in potential temporarily goes from \\\"-\\\" on the inside to \\\"+\\\" on the inside The local reversal in potential serves as the source of depolarizing current for adjacent membrane Na+ channels open in adjacent membrane Therefore, once started, an AP will propagate from its origin across the rest of the cell What is an axon? A long extension of the cell body (like a wire) that carry AP away to some other location You will find a lot of voltage gated-channels here. The action potential will propagate towards the end/axon terminal Only neurons with long axons and muscle cells generate propagating action potentials What is a synapse? The region where an axon terminal communicates with its postsynaptic target cell In cable properties, what is \\\"length constant\\\" (lambda) used to measure and what is it? It is used to measure how quickly a potential differences disappears (decays to zero) as a function of distance Thus, the conduction velocity of an AP along an axon depends on the membrane length constant, lambda Length constant is defined with internal resistance, extracellular fluid resistance and membrane resistance Since the extracellular fluid resistance is not adjustable and is relatively low, it drops from the equation and we're left with internal resistance and membrane resistance Ideally, you want to increase the length constant as much as possible so that the depolarzing current will spread a great distance What happens if you increase the length constant by increasing the diameter of an axon/cable? The larger the diameter = less internal resistance = less voltage is lost across that resistance as the current travels down the membrane What happens if you increase the length constant by increasing the membrane resistance of an axon/cable? The higher the membrane resistance = less current is leaked out = current is forced down the membrane What is myelination? Increasing membrane resistance is the most efficient means of increasing conduction velocity'Glial' cells are cells that assist the nervous system, they are required for nutrition and increase membrane resistance Specialized 'glial' cells (schwann cells of the PNS or olgodendrocytes within the CNS) wrap around successive sections of an axon for myelin sheath (Glial cells are sponsible for myelination)It does 50-100 layers wrapping around the axon which greatly increases the membrane resistance causing reduced leaked of current out of the membrane The negative aspect of this is it takes a lot of space causing it to be bulkier which means you cannot myelinated all axons There are small gaps left between adjacent portions of the myelin sheath (a glial cell will wrap one section and next glial cell will wrap another section. These gaps are called the Node of Ranvier What are glial cells? Cells that assist the nervous system They are required for nutrition and increased membrane resistance (myelination)What are Schwann cells? Glial cells in the PSN that wrap around successive sections of the axon to create a myelin sheath (myelination)Schwann cells wrap around a single portion of the one axon (cytoplasm is all squeezed-out)Participate in repair process after injury Can be stained by 1E8 and Herp What are Oligodendrocytes? Glial cells in the CNS that wrap around successive sections of the axon to create a myelin sheath (myelination)Oligodendrocyte has a number of processes that streaks out line an octopus and wraps a whole bunch of axons individually Provide structural frameworkcan be stained by CNPase What is the down side to myelination and why can you not do it to all axons? Takes of a lot of space causing it to be bulkier What are the Node of Ranvier? Small gaps left between adjacent glial cells on the axon. They are a section of unmyelinated axon membrane between Schwann/glial cells. It is passive What causes Multiple sclerosis (MS)? Loss of myelination causing messages not get transmitted well What are saltatory conduction? Saltatory conduction is the 'jumping' mode of condution In myelinated axons, only the membrane exposed at the nodes is excitable Because the APs are only generated at these nodes, it means that the AP will 'jump' from one place to the next and in-between, you are not generating any APThus, if have an AP on one node, the depolarizing current that is generated at the site is strong enough and will travel down the axon for many nodes (5-10), there is sufficient strength to bring all the following nodes to threshold potential Therefore, AP at one node will bring all the next 5-10 nodes to -50m V to generate APs on all the next nodes simultaneously and passive spread of depolarizing current occurs between the nodes (myelinated portion)Each AP creates another AP where different nodes will undergo different phases of APYou could poison some of the nodes and the depolarizing current will just skip past that and move onto the next healthy patch of membrane As long as one AP fire and reach the last one, it will transmit the message What does the myelin prevent? Leakage of current across membrane between nodes What happens if you poison some nodes in an axon? Because of saltatory conduction, the depolarizing current will just skip past those nodes and move onto the next healthy patch of the membrane. As long as one action potential fire and reach the last one, it will transmit the message How does myelination improve length constant? Depolarizing current spread further down the axon (prevent current leakage)How does increase diameter of an axon increase length constant? Depolarization current spread further as the inter-nodal distance is increase proportionately What are unmyelinated axons? Axons that have not been myelinated They do not have this extensive wrapping around the outside which means you get lots of current leakage and slows down the conductance velocity Majority of axons are unmyelinated Do unmyelinated axons have insulation? Yes The schwann cells and oligodendrocyte engulf the axon (5-30 axons) without winding to create a \\\"Remak Bundle\\\"What are axon terminals? AP will be conducted along the membrane right to the end of the cell where at the end of the cell, AP is still generating depolarizing currents AP cannot turn around and re-propagate in direction it came from because of refractory period, the voltage-gated Na+ channels are inactivated So at the end of the axon (the axon terminal), the AP dies out What are electrical synpases? Electrical signal is being transmitted by physical connection and does not require neurotransmitters It is bidirectional An electrotonic synpase (gap junctions) adjacent membranes are about 35A apart Gap junction bridge by connexins which allow small ions (and depolarization) to cross What are chemical synpases? The transmitter is released into the extracellular space which exists between adjacent cells The synpase is defined by the presynaptic surface (the bouton which contains the vesicles) and the postsynpatic membrane (which is the membrane of the adjacent neuron)Synpatic cleft (the space) is about 200A wide The synpatic cleft is very specialized due to existence of postsynaptic membrane, which contain specific protein receptors which will bind that transmitter molecule after its released This is all located at the axon terminal where the axons end in 'boutons' filled with vesicles. These vesicles are tiny organelles which contain neurotransmitters which is released into the extracellular fluid Fill in this chart:1) An action potential depolarizes the axon terminal2) The depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the Ca2+ enters the cell3) Calcium entry triggers the exocytosis of synpatic vesicle contents4) Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synpatic clef and bind with receptors on the postsynaptic cell5) Neurotransmitters binding initiates a response in the postsynpatic cell How do we get Ca++ ions into the bouton/axon terminal? Bouton membrane contains voltage-gated Ca++ channels which open when depolarized by AP current AP depolarizes the bouton membrane and when reaches threshold for opening voltage-gated Ca++ channels at -50m V, Ca++ diffuses into bouton and triggers cascade of reaction which result in vesicle exocytosis What are post synpatic receptors? Transmitter agent diffuses across synapses and binds to specific site on a receptor protein embedded in postsynpatic membrane Binding of transmitter causes a change in shape of the receptor protein It does not depend on the transmitter but rather the receptor that binds to the molecule There are two types of receptors:1) Ionotropic (directly opens channels)2) Metabotropic (initiates a metabolistic cascade to activate enzymes)What are ionotropic effects? Ligand binding opens an ion channel (ionotropic)Binding of the transmitter to the post-synpatic membrane results in the change in the post-synpatic membrane potential, this is called the post-synaptic potential (PSP)The duration of PSP is about 20-40ms Ion channel may be specific for cations (Na+, K+) are EPSP (depolarizing, excitatory)Ion channels that may be specific for Cl- or K+ ion are IPSP (hyperpoloarizing, inhibitory, making more negative)More so immediate effects What are nicotinic receptors for? Acetylcholine and nicotine Allows passage of cations in a fast process where it binds and opens What is botox used for? (Biologically, not cosmetically)Used to kill of the neurotransmitters which prevent the release of acetylcholine which is the message molecule that is needed to contract What does GABA generally generate? An inhibitory neurotransmitter The ligands for the ionotropic receptor are principally: Acetylcholine (Ach)Glutamate GABAGlycine What are metabotropic effects? Binding of the ligand in the post-synpatic metabotropic receptor activates an enzyme that is usually G-protein coupled The enzyme facilitation will result in increased production or destruction of second messengers Metabotropic receptor activation take take If you influence an ion channel through the metabolic effect, the change in MP will develop slowly Change is slow because of it has to go through all the enzyme activity first before influence the ion channels What are 2nd messengers? Are either c AMP, c GMP or In P3Activates other enzymes like phosphokinases which phosphorylate membrane proteins or other proteins in the cytoplasm If you phosphorylate membrane proteins (like ion channels), you result in moedulation of ion currents What does phosphokinase do? Phosphorylate membrane proteins or other proteins in the cytoplasm Why are metabotropic effects slow? Because it has to go through all the enzyme activity first before influence the ion channels What is a beta-adrenoreceptor or beta-receptor? A beta-receptor is a metabolic receptor for Noradrenalin (NA). Involved in G-protein couple enzymatic pathway Binding of NA to beta-receptor activates adenylyl cyclase via G-protein alteration Adenyl cyclase increases production of c AMP (a second messenger)c AMP then activates kinases which phosphorylate membrane Ca++ channels This phorphorylation of the Ca++ channel causes increase in Cal++ influx (increase contractility in the heart)What are beta-blockers? Causes disallowing excessive activity to the heart Can be used to calm someone down Why are Ca++ influx important in the heart? Increase contractility in the heart muscle In the heart, these calcium channels are important because more calcium allow greater and faster contractility What are some ligands for metabotropic receptors? ACh Peptides Catecholamines Serotonin Purines Gases Where are PSPs generated? In inexcitable membrane such as neuronal dendrites and cells bodies because these areas do not have high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels (they cannot initiate AP)PSP must spread through passive conduction across the membrane to get to the initial segment of the axon to create an APExplain what is going on here where this is in the cell body: Thispositive deflection is not an action potential because there are very fewvoltage gated channels but rather this is a graded potential as the sodium isstill coming in making more positive Where is the first place you general an action potential? At the trigger zone What is the process of PSP Summation? Need lots of EPSP added together to depolarize the trigger zone to -50m VHoping a conjugation of EPSP will create a combined effect called Summation to have a -50m V by the time it reaches the trigger zone There are two types of Summation:1) Spatial summation (minimum of 10-30 synchronous EPSP in dendritic tree, each generated at different synapse)2) Temporal summation (only a few active synapses, but each generating EPSP at high frequency; summated potentials reach threshold over a period of time)What is spatial summation? Minimum of 10-30 synchronous EPSP in dendritic tree, each generated at different synapse Large number of EPSPs in synchrony What is temporal summation? Only a few active synapses, but each generating EPSP at high frequency; summated potentials reach threshold over a period of time EPSPs last for about 30-40ms in duration before dying out, thus, successive inputs on any given synapse generates subsequent EPSPs that add onto the pre-existing EPSPs You are giving an additive staircase effect by having firing another potential before the one before dies off till it reaches -55m VWhat are IPSPs? Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potential IPSPs tend to be preferentially located on the cell soma, interposed 1/2 way between the site where EPSP is generated and the trigger zone IPSPs have strategic advantage due to its location close to the trigger zone, it can shunt depolarizing EPSP currents out of the cell How can IPSPs shunt depolarizing EPSP currents? If itis in located in-between the EPSP and initial segment, it will allow it toshunt or disallow the depolarizing current to reach the initial segment Explain the involvement of IPSP in the opening of Cl- channels The equilibrium potential for Cl- is very close to the resting MP (-70m V)Therefore at rest, opening of the Cl- channel would result in little change However, when the membrane is depolarized, opening of the Cl- channel will bring the MP back down to -70m VThe net affect of Cl- is basically to 'clamp' the MP, which is preventing excitation, thus preventing depolarization of inhibitory effect These IPSPs are very strategically located and they completely block any signal coming from EPSPs simply by positioning right on the soma IPSPsin general in the Nervous System, are more important than EPSPs What happens when you have a very powerful synaptic input to the post-synaptic neuron persisting in time lasting up to 500ms? Depolarizing the trigger zone to threshold and sustain that depolarization for 500ms, you want that powerful input to be translated into continuous streams of APs. This is called the 'Spike Train'If we depolarize the membrane above threshold and keep it there, you'll get one AP and the voltage-gated Na+ channels will inactivate (RP) and you cannot get another AP until the membrane repolarizes Therefore, after each 'spike' we need to get the membrane 'hyperpolarized' to restore the Na+ channels to re-open them for the next one Inorder to make a continuous action potential, we are going to have to usepotassium voltage gated channels where it will quickly bring down belowthreshold so it can fire another action potential Explain the after-hyperpolarization of a spike train Voltage-gated K+ channels at trigger zone cause after-hyperpolarizations Hyperpolarization after each spike ensures that Na+ channels reconfigure, the membrane excitability is restore After the hyperpolarization fades away (voltage-gated K+ channels will close when the membrane is repolarized), the MP will be able to shoot right back up where EPSP is taking it and cross the threshold again and a whole new spike and this will repeat until the EPSP fades away What is receptor potential? Change in the MP due to receipt of signal from exterior sensory cue The energy from the environment will react with membrane proteins and in general, this will cause depolarization (exception: photoreceptors hyperpolarize)Similar to PSP, the receptor proteins are embedded in sensory cell membrane The receptor proteins of the sensory cells will change shape when specific energy is received When receptor proteins change shape, it can either:1) Directly open ion channels2) Enzyme is activated via G-protein coupling leading to production of 2nd messengers to amplify the signal Explain the process of post-synaptic receptors1) Chemical stimulus binds to specific metabotropic receptor (G-protein coupled)2) Activation of G-protein3) Activate adjacent enzyme (adenyl cyclase)4) Produces 2nd messenger (c AMP)5) c AMP activates kinases which directly interact with ion channels or phosphorylate other proteins What are the two stages of amplification?1) G-protein can activate a number of different enzyme molecules2) Each of these enzyme molecules will produce lots of 2nd messengers (c AMP)What are the two categories of sensory cell transmission1) Sensory cell generates an action potential at a spike-generating zone2) Sensory cell releases vesicles when depolarized; impulses generated in post-synaptic neuron Explain the transmission of a signal by APLocated at the axon terminal, first patch of excitable membrane will generally be at the branch point, thus, the receptor potential will have to travel and generate summation at a branch point to reach threshold to get an APExplain the process the olfactory receptor goes through when encountering an odorant The depolarizing current has to travel down the membrane and down to the trigger zone of the axion1) Specific receptor proteins bind specific odorant2) Activate G-protein3) Activate adynyl cyclase4) Production of c AMP5) c AMP directly binds to ion channels6) Allow cations (Na+ and Ca++) to go through7) Depolarization of the membrane Explain transmission of signal by vesicles1) Depolarizing current don't produce AP2) Travel throughout the membrane and at the other end3) They depolarize the membrane sufficiently4) Influx of Ca++ ions and trigger exocitosis vesicles5) Sensory cell is releasing vesicles and not producing an APIn the aspect of MP, what is adaptation? MP can decay over time leading to Adaptation The original voltage is sustained and its dropped over time, even though the stimulus may be constant Two types: Slowly and Rapidly What is slow adaptation in the aspect of MP? Receptor potential sustained for duration of stimulus Interested in overall magnitude of the stimulus Though it decays, as long as it there, you get a stimulus What is rapid adaptation in the aspect of MP? Receptor potential elicited by change in stimulus energy, decays to zero when stimulus is constant Interested in how quickly the stimulus is being delivered, the velocity of stimulus being delivered Only interested in momentary changes and will go to zero if constant stimulus What is habituation in the aspect of MP? Habituation is the response to successive stimuli in time Repeated stimuli (identical) in succession elicit progressively weaker responses Habituation responses depend on the cell, some will show large degree and some won't What the two strategies to code for the strength of the stimulus?1) Increase frequency of AP at excitable membrane (increase intensity of stimulus = increase frequency of AP on receptor A)2) With increasing stimulus strength, we recruit an additional receptor B, which has a higher threshold What is population code/coding? Population coding is coding using the ratio of activity from a restricted number of different receptor types Specific stimulus is coded by ratio of activity across the population of receptors A given receptor (A) type will respond to a wide range, but it has a peak and that is different from others Thus, any given stimulus (dotted line) will activate one receptor (C) very strongly but others (A, B) more weakly What is receptive field? Each sensory neuron is going to respond to a particular spatial area called a receptive field Receptive field of a given sensory neuron is the territory in which you could activate that neuron Receptive field is always defined in relation to a given sensory neuron, each sensory neuron will have a different receptive field One sensory neuron may cover a lot of area or just one small area Receptive field in cutaneous sensory neuron is the skin territory in which adequate stimulation elicits a response and is generally about 10-20mm across Stimulation in any place in this receptive field will generate receptor potential Receptive field is not uniform What is axon reflex? AP can be initiated at the 'branch point' on one part of the sensory axon terminal to be carried to the CNSHowever, at the branch point, the AP can travel backwards back to the adjacent terminals by the axon reflex This conduction of AP backwards is known as antidromic conductance (away from CNS)Stimulation of the sensory neuron in the skin will cause antidromic AP to reach the adjacent terminals At the terminal, the pain receptors in skin will release substance P which trigger vasodilation What is orthodromic? Normal conduction Towards CNSYou cannot get backwards because going under absolute refractory period What is the blood-brain barrier? The brain and the spinal cord are protected from the general circulation and the body The ionic composition of the extracellular fluid around the neuron must be carefully controlled:1) Cannot change the excitability of the membrane2) Cannot have neurotransmitters floating around for no reason Thus, the extracellular fluid in the neuronal environment (brain and spinal cord) are carefully regulated through the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)In the brain, endothelial cells are tightly bound leaving no gaps where everything has to be transported What happens when you get a KCl injection?1) Decreased K+ concentration gradient2) Depolarization3) Inactivation of Na+ channel4) No more AP produced What causes Parkinson's disease? There is a lack of dopamine and problems in the receptor which causes muscle contraction You cannot inject dopamine as it cannot cross the BBBWhat is dopamine? It is a reward neurotransmitter People who lack this become more addicted What areas in the brain are lacking a BBB? Hypothalamus where essential for neurons to communicate freely with blood stream Pituitary gland for releasing hormones and is directly connected to the hypothalamus Cicumventiruclar organs (around 3rd ventricle) has a broken BBB so neurons can sense specific chemicals Generally, BBB is broken in areas that interact with endocrine system or require sensitivity to metabolites in plasma What is the brain encased by? The skull and the meninges What is the meninges? Dura mater (very touch membrane, sac containing the brain and the spinal cord)Arachnoid membrane (much more delicate tissue)Pia mater (lies right on top of the brain; tether to Arachnoid by Arachnoid 'Trabeculae')Between the arachnoid membrane and the Pia matter, Subarachoid space (filled with CSF) brain floats to protect from mechanical stress What is the reticular formation? This is an area that connects the brain to the spinal cord The reason why sports players wear mouth guards is not to protect the teeth but rather to prevent the mouth jaw bone to vibrate causes the wearer to lose conscious temporary Key organized of behavioural patterns of the body and consists of a network of cell bodies and interconnected axons Reticular formation projects to centromedian nucleus of thalamus What are fenestrations? The endothelial lining of the BV, mostly contain large gaps (called fenestrations) through which molecules can pass What are astrocytes? Provide a bridge between neurons and blood vessels It would pick up nutrients and bring it to the synpases They have two functions:1) Remove neurotransmitters2) Provide energy substrates for neurons and more They are following and latching onto BV (some end feet latched onto the BC and the others with neurons)Astrocytes also regulate local blood flow Provide structural support Regualte ion, nutrient, and dissolved gas concentrations Absorb and recycle neurotransmitters Form scar tissue after injury Can be stained by GFAPFound in the CSNAstrocytes surrounding neurons determine how you breath in and out, how you main autonomic functions How do astrocytes regulate local blood flow? Astrocytes are already bridging the gap between BV and neurons, so they are in a good spot to signal BV when to dilate and constrict (increase or decrease blood flow)Astrocytes have connection with the neuron at the synapse and when they detect increased signaling, they can send a metabolic signal outward to BC (opposite to nutrient flow), signaling neuronal activity level Glutamate in synapses trigger Ca++ release within astrocytes where Ca++ wave travels through astrocytes and trigger prostagladin (PGE2) release at end foo t What is PGE2? Prostagladin Released by astrocytes Caused vasodilation (increased blood flow)What are ventricles? Ventricles are cavities deep inside the brane A large curving Lateral Ventricle (LV) inside each cerebral hemisphere, a paired structure across the midline The LV empties into the 3rd ventricle, right in the middle, deep in the brain under the cerebral hemisphere The 3rd ventricle communicates via a channel called \\\"Aqueduct of Sylvius\\\" to the 4th ventricle From the 4th ventricle, we have a canal, \\\"Central Canal\\\", which goes in the middle of the spinal cord All these ventricles are filled with CSF which is the bathing medium of the brain (highly regulated ionic content, few macromolecules) which eventually drains into the venous system Where is CSF produced? From plasma by 'choroid plexus', which lines the ventricles What is CSF? Cerebrospinal fluid CSF produced by 'choroid plexus' in ventricles CSF filled ventricles and the subarachnoid space CSF has same osmolarity and [Na+] as blood Greatly reduced [K+], [Ca2+] and [Mg2+]Total volume on an average person is 215m LMost of the CSF is in subarachnoid space, serving as cushion What is adult neurogenesis? Production of new neurons into adulthood Memory formed during childhood (brain is still developing and making connections) are permanent (hard-wired, built into structure/motherboard)What did Kuhn et al showed in 1996? They showed the first unambiguous evidence for neurogensis in the dentate gyrus using the thymidine analo g: bromodeoxyuridine (Brd U)What is the hippocampus? Explicit memories (declaritive) and semantic facts Memory for meaning, concepts and facts about the world Episodic events such as memory for events that occur in the context of a specific time, place and circumstance and autobiographical What are the negative regulators of adult neurogenesis? Aging Stress (glucocorticoids)Inflammation Methamphetamine/opiates Nitric oxide Interleukin-6 (from activated microglia)Irradiation Antimitotic agents (MAM)What are positive regulators of adult neurogenesis? Enriched environment Antidepressants Caloric restrictions Growth factors (BDNF, BEGF, FGF)Pregnancy (prolactin)Electroconvulsive shock therapy Learning Physical activity (running)What is the CNS?

Once a stimulus activates a sensory receptor, that must be converted into a signal that can be recognized by the nervous system Example) by pressing up against an encapsulated nerve ending, this will cause an AP which will be transmitted along What is stimulus encoding? Once the stimulus has been encoded into an electrical signal, it can encode for different properties (duration, intensity, and location)There is often some overlap at discriminating sensory modalities Each receptor type is most sensitive to a particular type of stimulus. The brain thus associates a signal coming from a specific group of receptors with a specific modality This direct association between a receptor and sensation is called the labeled line coding Patch of skin is innervated by many different types of nerve endings.

Small diameter, unmyelinated What happens when you put an unknown weight on an muscle? Because it is an unknown weight, the muscle would stretch causing a pulled and applied stretch which sends a stretch signal back to get a stretch response When this happens, the muscle contracts back causing the muscle to become shorter Re-sensitization through the gamma fibre causing it to be pulled tight causing the interfusal fibre to also contract What happens when a muscle is stretched? When a muscle is stretched, primary sensory fibers (1a) of the muscle spindle responds to both the velocity and the degree of stretch Sensory information sent to spinal cord Secondary sensory fibers (II) detect and send information about the degree of stretch (but not the velocity)What are joint receptors? Attach to capsule enveloping the join t that can help tell where your muscle/joints are in space Group 2 and 3 sensory axons Golgi-Mazzoni corpuscles (paciniform) respond to orthgonal forces (compression)Ruffini endings respond to capsule strain (i.e. bending of the joint or of muscle pulling on the joint to determine if being put under heavier stress)What are the three pathways to the brain?

It is suspended by ligaments called zonules. In front of the lens is the anterior chamber, filled with aqueous humor, a low-protein plasma-like fluid. Behind the lens is the vitreous chamber, filled mostly with vitreous body, a clear gelatinous matrix that helps maintain the shape of the eyeball Biconvex, transparent, flexible and avascular It has two regions: lens epithelium (anteriorly) and lens fibers (form bulk of lens)Lens become more dense, convex, less elastic with age causing cataracts Its shape can alter the refraction of light In the eyeball, what is the fibrous layer? Outermost layer; dense avascular (not a lot of blood vessels) connective tissue Two regions: sclera and cornea What is the sclera in the eyeball?

Viterous humor has multiple functions such as transmitting light, support posterior surface of lens (give shape to eye), hold neural layer of retina firmly against pigmented layer, contributes to intraocular pressure, forms in embryo (last lifetime)What does the anterior segment of the internal chamber composed of and contains? Two chambers: Anterior chamber between cornea and iris Posterior chamber between iris and lens It contain aqueous humor which is a plasma like fluid continuously formed by capillaries of ciliary processes (found inside the eye and inside the chamber), drains via scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm) at sclera-cornea junction, supplies nutrients and oxygen mainly to lens and cornea but also to retina and removes wastes What is glaucoma? Blocked drainage of aqueous humor increases pressure and causes compression of retina and optic nerve which lea d s to blindness The optic nerve is part of the CNS which you cannot regrow It is usually associated with increase intraocular pressure, sometimes caused by excess aqueous humor Treatment may involve drugs to inhibit production of aqueous humour, or surgery to reopen the canal of Schlemm Optic nerve damage in glaucoma may involve nitric oxide or apoptosis-inducing factors What is lens fibers? Form bulk of the lens Filled with transparent protein crystalling What is cataracts? Clouding o f lens Consequences of aging, diabetes mellitus, heavy smoking, frequent exposure to intense sunlight Can be genetic Has crystallin proteins clump. Some evidence to suggest that vitamin C increases cataract formation Lens can be replaced surgically with artificial lens Explains what happens when light passes through the pupil: The pupil shrinks and dilates with the contraction and relaxation of a ring of smooth pupillary muscles, so it can affect the amount of light that reaches the retina In bright sunlight, the pupil shrinks to 1.5mm across as parasympathetic signals constrict the pupillary muscles In the dark, the pupils dilate to 8mm as sympathetic signals contract radial muscles orthogonal to the pupillaries Explain the pupillary/consensual reflex The examiner shines a light into one eye Signals travel along the eye's optic nerve (cranial nerve 2) to the thalamus, then to the midbrain From there, signals travel along parasympathetic fibers of cranial nerve 3 to constrict the pupils of both eyes How does the pupil control depth of field? When the pupil is tightly constricted, then we have full depth of field When the pupil is dilated, then we have a shallow depth of field That distance to one specific object of vision is called the focal length and depends on the shape of the lens What happens if the lens is too flattened? Lens doesn't bend the rays enough to bring them to a focus on retina, retinal image will be fuzzy Can be brought into focus by make lens rounder What is accommodation in the sense of lens? The fattening of the lens for near vision Weakens with age (called presbyopia)It is an unconscious reflex What are ciliary muscles? Smooth muscle that control the lens shape When the ciliary muscle is relax, the ring is wide and the tension of the zonules pulls the lens flat When the ciliary muscles contract, the ring is tighter so tension decreases and the lens round What is hyperopia? Far-sightedness The focal point falls behind the retina Fixed with a convex lens What is myopia? Near-sightedness Focal point falls in front of the retina Eyeball is elongated Fixed with a concave lens How does your brain see images? Images are actually seen inverted so your brain flips the inverted image What light wavelengths can human see? Visible light of 400-700nm and cannot see outside of it What is phototransduction? Conversion of light energy into electrical energy In humans, phototransduction occurs in the retina, in light-sensitive neurons called photoreceptors The photoreceptors are most densely packed in an area of retina called the macula which is an area specialized for high-acuity vision What is the fovea? The inner part of the macula Where do the photorceptors lie in the retina? The outer layer Therefore, the other neurons and their axons lie between the photoreceptors and the light, but these inner layers are mainly transparent Melanin in the pigment epithelium absorbs any light ray that escape the photoreceptors so it prevents reflected rays corrupting the retinal imag e. The choroid layer contains blood vessel What are photoreceptor cones? High-acuity and colour vision in bright light They are densely packed in the fovea, a pit in the center of the macula that contains only cones and no other cells to block the light Three types of cones prefer different wavelengths for red, green and blue light The brain deduces colours from activities of the 3 types What are photoreceptor rods? More sensitive, so they function in low light Outnumber cones 20:1In dark l ight, you are using your rods but they cannot discriminate colour but because the y are more sensitive, they outnumber cones What is the basic structure of rods and cones for photorecptors? In an outer segment, the membrane folds into disk-like layers (in rods, the outermost disk are detached from the cell). The disks contain visual pigments that transduce light into changes in membrane potential In an inner segment are the nucleus and organelles for ATP and protein synthesis; and in a basal layer, a synapse that release glutamate What is rhodopsin and the process associated with it? Rods have one kind of visual pigment, rhodopsin, composed of 2 molecules:1) Opsin: a protein in the membrane2) Retinal: vitamin-A derivative that is light-absorbing part In darkness, retinal binds opsin. A single photon can make retinal change shape and release its opsin (in a process called bleaching which alters MP)The process associated with it goes:1) Retinal absorbs light and changes shape. Visual pigment activates. Changing from 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal.2) Visual pigment activates transducin3) Transducin activates phosphodiesterase (PDE)4) PDE converts c GMP into GMP causing c GMP levels to fall5) As c GMP levels fall, c GMP-gated cation channels close, resulting in hyperpolarization In darkness, c GMP levels are high in the rod cytosol. K+ and cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are open and the rod is slightly depolarized to -40m VAs a result, Ca++ channels are open in the synaptic terminal and so glutamate is released onto bipolar cells Why do humans have 3 different types of opsins? As certain types of fruits that are high with carbohydrates that can spend on our brain, they change colour so if we can see that, that would be an advantage What is PDE? Phosphodiesterase Convets c GMP into GMPWhat happens when [c GMP] concentration falls in photoreceptors? CNG channels close, slowling or stopping the influx of cations K+ efflux continues so the membrane potential falls to -70m V and less glutamate is released Activated retinal difffuses out of the rod and is transported into pigment epithelium In the recovery phase, retinal recombines with opsin. Retinal reverts to its inactive form in the pigment epithelium, then returns to the rods and recombines with opsin to make inactive rhodopsin. What is nyctalopia? Night blindness Rod degeneration Commonly caused by vitamin A deficiency If administered early, vitamin A supplements restore function Can be caused by retinitis pigmentosa What is retinitis pigmentosa? Degenerative retinal diseases that destroy rods True o r false: Photoreceptors and bipolar cells only generate grades potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs)True When light hyperpolarizes photoreceptor cells, it stops releasing inhibitory neurotransmitter glutamate, bipolar cells depolarize and release neurotransmitter onto ganglion cells and genglion cells generate AP transmitted in optic nerve to brain How does light turn into an AP?1) c GMP-gated channels close, so cation influx stops. Photoreceptor hyperpolarizes2) Voltage-gated Ca++ channels close in synpatic terminals3) No neurotransmitter is released4) Lack of IPSPs in bipolar cell results in depolarization5) Depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca++ channels; neurotransmitter is released6) EPSPs occur in ganglion cell7) Action potentials propagate along the optic nerve What are amarcine cells? Synapses with bipolar and ganglion cells What are horizontal cells? Synapses with photoreceptors and bipolars Help shape the convergence down to the level of the retinal ganglion cell What are the two types of bipolar cells? ON (or light-on): Bipolar cells have a metabotropic glutamate receptor, m Glu R6, that hypoerpolarizes the cell when it binds glutamate. So these cells are active in light, when less glutamate is secreted by photoreceptors OFF (or light-off): Bipolar cells have an ionotropic glutamate receptor that depolarizes the cell when it binds glutamate. So these cells are active in darkness What are visual fields? Receptive fields of ganglion cells and other visual neurons Ganglion cells near the fovea have small receptive fields because only a few photoreceptors project to these cells, and so our visual acuity is high in this region Ganglion cells in the periphery of the retina have large receptive fields, because they receive input from many photoreceptors, so our acuity is low there What is an on-center/off-surround ganglion cell? Excited by light falling on the center of its receptive field Is inhibited by light falling in its surround What is an off-center/on-surround ganglion cell? Inhibited by light falling on its center Excited by light on its surround What are magnocellular ganglion cells? AKA M cells.

Flexor How does transduction involve ion channels in the receptor's membrane? The stimulus opens or closes ion channels directly or via a second messenger Usually a channel is opened, letting Na+ or other cations into the cell, depolarizing the membrane In a few cases K+ leaves the cell, hyperpolarizing the membrane In the case of vision, light closes cation channels, hypoerpolarizing the receptor membrane What is a threshold? Minimal stimulus that will activate/produce an action potential in the receptor itself or its downstream sensory neuron What is perceptual threshold? Minimal stimulus that will make you aware of a sensation It depends on attention, as the brain can filter out certain stimuli when you are drowsy or attending to something else This can help determine if you are smelling something good or hearing something What are primary (or first-order) sensory neurons? The first neurons in the system. These are the actual neurons that propagate action potentials They have synapses onto secondary sensory neurons which synapse onto tertiary and so on At each stage, many presynpatic neurons may provide input to one or a few postsynaptic neurons, a pattern called convergence, which allows secondary and teriary and higher neurons to combine information from many receptors What is convergence (in aspect of neurons)? Where many presynaptic neurons may provide input to one or a few postsynaptic neurons which allows secondary, tertiary and higher neurons to combine information from many receptors What is stimulus modality? Determine whether it is a light, sound or touch Indicate modality by labeled lines (activity on neurons in the visual pathway is interpreted by the CNS to mean light; in the auditory pathway it means soun d)Where does the olfactory pathway pass through in the brain? Through the olfactory bulb It bypasses the thalamus but goes to the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus Where is the auditory cortex found in (which brain lobe)? Temporal What are chemoreception? Chemoreception is evolutionary old: bacteria use it to guide their movements; animals without brains use it to find food and mates May have evolved into chemical synaptic communications Smell and taste are forms of chemoreception These receptors are primary olfactory neurons, which project into the olfactory bulb What is the olfactory bulb? The olfactory bulb is an extension of the forebrain and lies on the underside of the frontal lobe What do olfactory neurons make synaptic connections with? Primary order neurons Axons of primary sensory neurons form the olfactory nerve and synapse with secondary sensory neurons in the olfactory bulb Explain what developing neurons do in the olfactory sensory? Stem cells in the basal layer of the olfactory epithelium continuously divide to create new neurons. As you get older, you are less likely to grow more stem cells and regenerate neurons (which can proceed the development of Alzheimer's disease)These developing neurons will have to send a projection up into the mitral cells as well as sending out a process down to the mucus layer as they start to develop Describe odorant receptors: Each odorant receptor is a protein which is responsible for transducing a sense into electrical activity which will then activate primary neuron cells These are G protein-coupled membrane proteins (each GPCR is different and will bind a different odorant and different combiantions of odorant receptors allow us to smell many odors)When an odorant molecule binds its receptor protein, it activates a G protein, Golf, which increases the local concentration of c AMPc AMP-gated cation channels open, depolarizing the cell and triggering an action potential that travels along the axon to the bulb There are also pain and temperature receptors in the nasal cavities What is the odorant receptor pathway?1) Single odorant binds to the odorant receptor (odorants dissolve best in liquid and doesn't interact well with its receptor unless in a psuedoaqueious environment)2) Receptor activates G proetin (G_olf)3) G-protein activates adenylate cyclase which converts ATP into c AMP4) c AMP opens cation channels, allowing Na+ and Ca2+ influx and causing depolarization The Na+ causes depolarization and impulse transmission Ca++ causes olfactory adaptation which is a decrease response to sustained stimulus There will also be Cl- leaving the cell which will bring its negative charge from inside to outside causing a further membrane depolarization Why do animals have a more sensitive and powerful sense of smell than humans? Animals per unit area imbedded in the cilia tend to be much higher in animals so molecules have a much easier probability of finding a receptor in animal olfactory system than in humans What are mitral cells? They are responsible for detecting different types of odors. They can amplify, refine and relay signals. They can send signals towards the brain Olfactory receptor cells synapse with mitral cells in glomeruli of olfactory bulbs Can be inhibited by amacrine granule cells releasing GABAImpulses from activated mitral cells travel via olfactory tracts to piriform lobe of olfactory cortex Some information to frontal lobe (smell consciously interpreted and identified)Some information to hypothalamus, amygdala, and other regions of limbic system (emotional responses to odor elicited/where smell is part of your memory)What do amacrine granule cells do? They release GABA to inhibit mitral cells (only highly excitatory impulses transmitted)What is a glomeruli? A series of synaptic connections that make their way from the sensory cell to the mitral cell All the receptors that is sending up to the glomeruli is interacting with the same odorant Fill in the missing labels: What is vomeronasal organ (VMO)? In rodents, an accessory olfactory structure in the nasal cavity, the vomeronasal organ, is involved in behavioural responses to sexpheromones There i no clear evidence for a VMO in humans, but there may be compounds that act as human pheromones What can umami be activated by? MSG like meat and cheese It can also signal nutrients (sugar and glutamate)What can trigger sour taste? H+What can trigger salty taste? Na+What do tight junctions do in the tongue? These get activated by ligands which will activate G-protein coupled receptors What do Type 1 cells do on the tongue? Type 1 (support) cells may sense salt Believed to be activated by ions It is a polarized epithelial cell Sweet and umami involves T1R receptors What do Type 2 cells do on the tongue? Type 2 (receptor) cells sense sweet, bitter and umani Release ATP which acts on neurons and Type 3It is a polarized epithelial cell It expresses G-protein-coupled receptors Bitter involves ~30 T2R receptors These receptor proteins are associated with a G-protein called gustducin, which activates signal-transduction pathways These pathways increase intracellular [Ca++], triggering release of ATP through what looks like exocytosis What do type 3 cells do on the tongue? Type 3 (presynaptic) cells sense sour These are the only type cells on the tongue that form synapses with sensory neurons, activating them with serotonin It is a polarized epithelial cell Do salty and sour transduction involve ion channels or G-proteins? Ion channels Na+ enters Type 1 cells through apical channel, such as epithelial Na+ channel, depolarizing the cell Sour is controversial. It involves Type 3 cells but it is not clear whether H+ acts on receptor or enters the cell. H+ may act on ion channels from both the intra- and extra-cellular sides of the membrane (H+ can either directly enter cell or block efflux of K+)What cranial nerves does the axons of gustatory neurons travel through?7, 9, 10They synapse in medulla, from there the pathway leads to the thalamus and then the gustatory cortex Describe the nerve endings in the mouth: The nerve endings in the mouth have TRP receptors activated by capsaicin, menthol, cinnamon, mustard, etc. and projecting via the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V)What is the fifth cranial nerve? The trigeminal nerve Describe the gustatory pathway: Cranial nerves 7 and 9 carry impulses from taste buds to solitary nucleus of medulla Impulses then travel to thalamus and from there fibers branch to gustatory cortex in the insula and the hypothalamus and limbic system (appreciation of taste)Vagus nerve transmit from epiglottis and lower pharynx What are anosmias? Olfactory disorders The first sense that disappears as you get older Proceeds neurodegenerative diseases Most results of head injuries and nuerological disorders (such as Parkinson's disease)Example would be uncinate fits What is uncinate fits? Olfactory hallucinations Olfactory auras prior to epileptic fits People who have epileptic seizures say they smell something that isn't there before it happens What does the external ear consist of? Pinna and the ear canal, sealed at its end by the tympanic membrane, or eardrum What is the middle ear? An air-filled space connected to the pharynx by the Eustachian tube What does the inner ear contain? Vestibular apparatus for equilibrium and cochlea for hearing What is the vestibular apparatus? Also known as the membranous labyrinth It is a set of fluid-filled chambers Contains the cristae, maculae, saccule and other sections There are 3 orthogonal (90 degree to one another) canals, for the 3 dimensions of head rotation The horizontal canal sense side-to-side rotation, as in shaking your head \\\"no\\\"; the superior and posterior canals sense up-and-down nodding and ear-to-should tilt Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and ends in a bulge (ampulla) containing its cristia What is the saccule? Tell us if our head is going up or down What is the cristae? The cristae of the semicircular canals sense the rotational acceleration of the head What is the maculae? The maculae of the 2 otolith organs (utricle and saccule) sense the head's tilt and translational acceleration Which canal of the vestibular apparatus detects side-to-side rotation? The horizontal canel Which canal (s) of the vestibular apparatus detect up-and-down and ear-to-should tilting? Superior and posterior canals What is the fluid in the canals of the vestibular apparatus? Endolymph What are hair cells? These cells have stiff cilia called sterocilia in their apical membranes The cilia extends into a gelatinous mass called the cupula, which seals off the canal When the head turns, the endolymph, owning to its inertia, lags behind and so pushes on the cupula, bending the hairs (if head swings right, then endolymph bends the hairs to the left)Thereis a polarity towards the longest of the cilia (kinocllium) where there areother, non-longest sterocilia which point towards the kinocllium which gives itsome directionality and when they bendin g a certain direction, they cause different receptors to open which can leadto depolarization leading to more glutamate so can tell where head is benttowards by direction of sterocilium If the hairs bend toward the kinocilium, then the hair cell depolarizes and releases transmitter, activating a sensory neuron; if the bend away, the cell hyperpolarizes Hair cells are tonically active, releasing neurotransmitter onto primary sensory neurons What is the kinocilium? The longest cilia on the hair cell What happens if hair cell's cilia bend toward the kinocilium? Depolarization and release of transmitter, activating the sensory neuron What happens if the hair cell's ciliar bend away from the kinocilium? Hyperpolarizes What is the otolith membrane? In the maculae, hair cells extend their steocilia into a gelantinous otolith membrane On the membrane's surface are particules of calcium carbonate and protein, called otoliths. When gravity or acceleration moves the otoloiths then the membrane moves with them, bending the hairs When the head is upright, the macula of the utricle is horizontal and that of the saccule is vertical When the head is tilted, gravity bends the hairs. As the calcium otolith slides, it drags along the sterocilia with it where in this orientation, they will be excited as they are pulled towards the longer cilia. What is the cochlea? The cochlear hair cells activate primary sensory neurons of the cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve 8)There are three bones here which are needed to amplify the vibration up against the eardrum by 22 fold so that movements of air can becomes movements of fluids in the cochlea What is sound? Pressure waves At the peaks of waves, the molecules are crowded together and the pressure is high; at the troughs the molecules are far apart and the pressure is low What is frequency and how do we (humans) perceive it? Frequency is the number of peaks that pass a given point each second We perceive frequency as pitch (the changes in frequency) where low frequencies as low-pitched sounds and high frequencies as high-pitched sounds Frequency is measured in waves per seconds: Hertz (Hz)Most people can hear frequencies from 20-20,000 Hz. Acuity is highest from 1000-3000Hz In the aspects of sound/hearing, what is amplitude? Amplitude is the pressure difference between peak and trough Amplitude is the main factor that determines our perception of loudsness: small-amplitude waves are soft, large amplitudes are loud More precisely, loudness relates to sound intensity, a function of amplitude measured in units called decibels (d B) that are logarithmic (in increase of 10d B means a 10-fold increase in intensity)Normal conversation is ~60d B where >80d B can damage hearing How is sound energy conveyed in the cochlea? By the bones in the middle ear They will vibrate at the same frequency as the air Sound waves shake the eardrum and the attached malleus bone transduces sound waves into vibrations Malleus connects to incus which connects to stapes, which seals off the oval window leading into the cochlea. These 3 bones amplify the vibration as they convey it to the inner ear Where can perilymph be found? In the vestibular duct (or scala vestibuli) and tympanic duct (scala tympani)Where can endolymph be found? In the cochlear duct (scala media)By the way: it has high [K+] and low [Na+]What is the organ of corti? In this chamber and only this chamber, the organ of corti allows you to hear It is rich in K+ which can hyerpolarize where if it comes into the cell, in this case, it depolarizes the hair cells It sits on top of the basilar membrane and under the tectorial membrane. All the hair cells sit on the basilar membrane which go from ovial window to tree line. Each hair cell has 50-100 sterocilia, which extend into the tectorial membrane The fluid waves in the perilymph deform the basilar and tectorial membranes, bending the cilia back and forth What is IHC (in relation to hearing)? Inner Hair Cell Detects sounds As it detect sounds, it bounces up and down causing fluids in the chamber to move with it which will pull open the tectorial membrane What are tip links? Sterocilia are attached by protein bridges called tip links which open and close ion channels in the cilia membrane At rest, ~10% of the channels are open They will close when hair cell is being hyperpolarized They can break if they move around too much and when this happens, you hear a ringing sound as it cannot close and is constantly active where the neuron is constantly will be excited Do we hear bilaterally? Yes, there is a crossing over event at the cochlear nuclei in the medulla. Explain how the brain localizes sounds based on loudness and timing: If a sound is louder in the right ear, than in the left it is coming from the right side of the head. Loudness is conveyed by firing frequency like how louder sounds make auditory sensory neurons fire at a faster rate What are the three kinds of hearing loss? Conductive Central Sensorineural What is conductive hearing loss? Sound cannot be transmitted through the external or middle ear to the CNSWhat is central hearing loss? There is damage in the cortex or the pathways from cochlea to cortex What is sensorineural hearing loss? There is damage to the hair cells or elsewhere in the inner ear. M ammals cannot replace dead hair cells but birds can. What are cochlear implants? Restored hearing to many deaf people A tiny microphone, processor and transmitter fit behind the ear. These convert sound into electrical impulses and then into radio waves, and send the radio signal to a receiver and 8-24 electrodes under the skin The electrodes relay the signals to the cochlea or the auditory nerve, bypassing any damaged areas After surgery, recipients are trained to understand what they hear. What is simple reflexes? Sensory neurons make synapses with spinal cord monotneurons to mediate simple reflexes Simplest form of motor control What are CPGs (is aspect of movement)? Central Pattern Generators Networks of interneurons in the spinal cord and brainstem coordinate the interaction of many different motor groups (locomotion, respiration)Anything rhythmic requires CPGs Are located principally in the spinal cord and brainstem (and also hypothalamus)CPGs are activated in order of relevance Important in behaviour responses Important in locomotion and motor control What is complex/volitional movement? Motor output that is planned and refined by the motor cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum Explain the reflex arc:1) Arrival of stimulus and activation of receptor2) Activation of sensory neuron (free nerve ending which will send signals back up spinal cord through dorsal horn, this is a polysynaptic response)3) Information processing in CNS4) Activation of a motor neuron5) Response by effector What is the stretch reflex? Stimulus: passive stretch of a muscle by applied load or contraction of antagonist muscle (75m/s)Response: active contraction of muscle Very sensitive and fast due to muscle spind afferents, and monosynpatic connection to motoneurons Essential for stabilizing posture; reflex strongest in postural muscles Short latencies of about 25ms for forearm muscles, 37ms for ankle extensors Parallel multisynaptic paths through spinal cord and a transcortical path During movement, reflex suppressed What is the golgi tendon reflex? Stimulus: active tension in muscle Response: relaxation or reduction of tension GTO afferents (lb) synapse on interneurons in intermediate zone of spinal cordlb-interneurons inhibit (alpha)-motoneurons of same muscle Golgi tendon reflex signals the lb axon (large diameter, myelinated) to relax which prevents over contraction when a load is picked up What it does is prevent movement Acts in concert with stretch reflex to stabilize posture Suppressed when net motion is desired (when we move, we turn Golgi tendon reflex off)What is the stimulus and response for a stretch reflex? Stimulus: Passive stretch of muscle Response: Active contraction of muscle What is the stimulus and response of Golgi tendon reflex?

Stimulus: Noxious injury of limb Response: Flexion of joints proximal to stimulus What is reciprocal inhibition? Intermediate zone neurons are found between ventral region of spinal cord Basic property of intermediate zone is reciprocal inhibition: the activation of one motor nucleus is coupled to inhibition of antagonistic motor nucleus (activation of flexor motoneurons elicits inhibition of antagonist extensors)When co-contraction of antagonists desired (for joint stiffness), this circuit is suppressed What is crossed extension? Full expression of flexion withdrawal reflex involves contralateral extension for increased postural support (mainly in legs)Commissural interneurons carry signal to contralateral spinal cord The only way the other leg to know what to do, the same interneuron to call withdrawn, it will go to the other leg and extend to provide support This reflex is sorta voluntary What does ipsilateral mean? Same side where stimulus is recieved What does contralateral mean? Opposite side of where stimulus is received What is extensor thrust reflex? Stimulus: Pressure on sole of foot (innocuous)Response: Activation of leg extensors A (beta) mechanoreceptors project to intermediate zone interneurons to extensor motoneurons Reflex operates only during stance It is influenced by the contricospinal tract Can be elicited at rest (like in toes by vigorous stroking of sole of foot)If contricospinal tract is damaged (stroke, spinal injury), the reflex pattern is switched to flexion withdrawal What is Babinski pattern? If youdamage your spinal cord, your toes will do opposite which is a switch of antigravity pattern to a flexion withdrawal What is the stimulus and response of extensor thrust reflex? Stimulus: Pressure on sole of foot (innocuous)Response: Activation of leg extensors What is presynaptic inhibition? Presynaptic inhibition of afferent or interneuronal terminals is main mechanism for regulating and switching reflex effects When on route to a motor nucleus is inhibited, another can be disinhibited What is the vestibulospinal reflex? Normal purpose is to stabilize the body Stimulus: Downward deviation of head on one side to activate otolith afferents Response: 'downhill' limbs extend As youtilt your head on one side or the other, you get ipsilateral extension of motorneurons, and contralateral flexion on the opposite side Otolith afferents activate lateral vestibulo-spinal tract: ipsilateral projection to extensor (antigravity) motor nuclei on side head is turned and flexors induced on opposite side What is the stimulus and response of vestibulospinal reflex? Stimulus: Downward deviation of head on one side to activate otolith afferents Response: 'downhill' limbs extend What is vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)? This is the concentration/fix on a gaze Stimulus: Head angular rotation; excites semicircular canals (rightward rotation excites right horizontal canal afferents)Response: Eye movement at opposite angular velocity to head rotation Canal afferents project to superior vestibular nucleus where VOR is organized Eye saccade occurs first (less ienrtia or less effort to move these) when tracking something or someone When head starts to move, if eye is already on target, the head movement will shift gaze off the target As soon as eye foveates target, VOR is 'turned on', stabilizing gaze despite continuing head movement What is the stimulus and response of VOR? Stimulus: Head angular rotation; excites semicircular canals (rightward rotation excites right horizontal canal afferents)Response: Eye movement at opposite angular velocity to head rotation How does VOR function? Eye saccade occurs first (less in e rtia or less effort to move these) when tracking something or someone When head starts to move, if eye is already on target, the head movement will shift gaze off the target As soon as eye foveates target, VOR is 'turned on', stabilizing gaze despite continuing head movement What is the stimulus of stretch reflex, Golgi tendon reflex, flexion withdrawal, extensor thrust, vestiboluspinal and VOR? Stretch: Passive stretch of a muscle by applied load or contraction of antagonist muscle (75m/s)Golgi tendon: Active tension in muscle Flexion withdrawal: Noxious injury of limb Extensor thrust: Pressure on sole of foot (innocuous)Vestiboluspinal: Downward deviation of head on one side to activate otolith afferents VOR: Head angular rotation; excites semicircular canals (rightward rotation excites right horizontal canal afferents)Which reflex would give me 'downhill' limb extension? Vestiboluspinal reflex What reflex would give be active contraction of muscles? Stretch reflex What reflex would I want to use when I want to reduce tension on muscles? Golgi tendon reflex Explain the leg step cycle: The step cycle of each leg during walking is programmed by a network of neurons within the intermediate zone of the lumbar cord Properties of the network:1) Pacemaker neurons, diffuse excitation2)Reciprocal inhibition3) Phase-dependent reflexes What are the \\\"half-center\\\" structures of CPG?1) Flexor burst generator network of neurons drives flexor motor nuclei (within intermediate zone) - lifts leg then turns off2) Extensor burst generator drives extension Both are spontaneously active when not inhibited and they can mutually inhibit one another What is flexor burst generator? The fluxion phase of the leg swing has a fixed duration, regardless of the speed of locomotion Flexor network has a build-up of inhibition that eventually stops the burst of action potentials which end of activation of flexor motoneurons Reciprocal inhibition of extensor burst network ceases causing extensor network active In the transition to leg swing, when would the E3 phase stop?1) Leg is not bearing weight2) Hip is extended3) Opposite leg is in stance (bearing weight)Crossed projections provide correct phase-linking of CPGs on each side Describe the CPGs role in arm swings: CPGs in cervical cord program motion of arms during walking Flexion phase in arms is synchronous with contra-lateral flexion in leg: diagonal pattern to cancel torque on trunk This phase-linking occurs via propriospinal tracts Describe the CPGs role in upper body balance: Bipedal humans must produce postural compensation in the trunk and head to maintain stability on top of moving legs Requires postural CPGs in reticular formation to coordinate upper body motion with spinal step cycles Spinally injured patients cannot walk without trunk support Spinoreticulothalamic pathways send information centrally about large regions of the body How is the stability of the head angle maintained? By combinations of visual vestibular and propioceptive reflexes What is mesencephalic locomotory region? This is a midbrain 'switch' that turns on reticulospinal locomotory CPGs which then activate spinal CPGs [locomotion starts with weight shift (postural change)]Governs speed of locomotion: the faster the rate of impulses, the faster the locomotion No pattern generation though (MLR just initiates the locomotion, does NOT generate patterns)Locomotion ALWAYS start with weight shift How is there postural maintenance? Organized in reticular formation of pons and medulla Relies on 3 sensory sources:1) Somatosensory (especially proprioceptive)2) Vestibular (gravitational reference)3) Visual (slower system, but important vertical cues and motion cues)Describe eye-head co-ordination: Movement to inspect novel visual stimulus is programmed in superior colliculus This area computes how much and in what direction gaze must be shift to 'foveate' target Send same motor signal to extraocular and neck motor centers Eye-head coordination is function of VORDescribe the collicular spatial map: Position of activated cells in s. colliculus codes spatial location of visual/auditory stimulus Spatial map is calibrated for eyes/head facing straight forward Activated cells provide motor signal to shift gaze in order to foveate stimulus What is synergy? A group of muscles contracting together for a specific purpose Synergies that are organized by reticulospinal tract are very widespread (typically cover half of the body) for generating support postures In contrast, rubrospinal (and corticospinal) synergies are highly localized What is the red nucleus? It is actually red in colour and part of the spinal synergy Rubrospinal cells within the red nucleus activate localized synergies, especially in distal limbs and in the face (gripping and twisting movements of hands)Reticulospinal and vestibulo-spinal tracts organize widespread postural and locomotory synergies What is the motor cortex? Located on the precentral gyrus, has somatotopic organization Layer 5 pyramidal cells are large; project to motor nuclei and interneurons in brainstem and spinal cord (corticobulbar/spinal tract)Direct corticospinal synapses on moto-neurons mostly to distal limb and speech motor nuclei What is a motor field? For motor fields, we are talking about how one corticospinal axon synapses with a set of motor nuclei, in more than one spinal segment Set of synaptic contacts with motor nuclei constitutes the motor field; many synapses are 'silent'Some motor nuclei much more strongly influenced than others The motor field provides potential for plasticity What are somatosensory inputs? Only sensory input with direct access to motor cortex Cutaneous input comes from somatosensory association areas; related to postural and motion information Proprioceptive input direct from thalamus (and from somatic association cortex)What are transcortical reflexes? Allow you to adjust influx incoming Much more versatile and modifiable than spinal reflexes Proprioceptive signals from one muscle can be used to trigger contractions in other muscles leading to synchronize actions at several joints When proprioceptive afferent inputs are lost, the person cannot synchronize reversals of motion at elbow and shoulder. Arm trajectories become both arbitrary and totally inconsistent What is the grasp reflex? Transcortical cutaneous reflex Slippage of object in fingers activates mechanoreceptors Direction of slip computed in somatosensory association areas Increased finger tension triggered in motor cortex What is the premotor area in the cortex? Set of regions projecting into motor cortex (but also with parallel routes to motor nuclei)Select motor cortical synergies into proper sequence for a given movement Pattern generation role for learned, highly evolved movement Different premotor areas need to be activated depending on what we want to do It processes sensory inputs, especially visual and auditory for cueing movement phases (dorsal visual stream to dorsal half (spatial location), ventral visual stream to ventral half)What is Broca's area? Premotor zone for sequencing language elements for speech or writing-typing input from Wernicke's area What is preparatory activity? Premotor neurons set up the motor cortex Hence they often are not active during performance Typically active during preparatory phase of movement: facilitating appropriate synergies in motor cortex Premotor neurons are typically active only when they are preparing the motor cortex, but not when the motor responses/contractions are actually occuring What is the supplmentary motor area (SMA)?

NTS - information includes blood pressure and gut distension Reticular formation - from CN X. among them is information about skin temperature, which is relayed to the hypothalamus Retina - some fibers from the optic nerve go directly to a small nucleus within the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (this nucleus regulates circadian rhythms, and couples the rhythms to the light/dark cycles)Limbic and olfactory systems - regulate behaviours such as eating and reproduction What is thermogenesis? If skin temperature is different form body temperature, information relayed from skin detecting changes in the environment There are Thermoreceptors at base of hypothalamus (these can also detect changes in the environment)Interestingly, it appears that warm-sensitive neurons greatly outnumber (and are more sensitive) than cold-sensitive neurons and that these neurons ultimately control thermogenesis More likely to have a homestatic response by raising your temperature by 1C than lowering it by 1CWhen its too cold, the reaction/response would be skin vasoconstriction, piloerection, decreased cardiac output, shift of fluid out of plasma, and shivering (a somatomotor effect from posterior hypothalamus). This is all an adrenergic input When its too put, the reaction/response would be skin vasodilation, sweating, increased cardiac output, shift of fluid into plasma from extracellular space, ADH release to prevent loss of fluid through urination (anterior hypothalamus). This is all an serotonergic input. What is piloerection?

Leptin, secreted by white adipose tissue, provides long-term suppression of feeding by inhibiting NPY-containing neurons within the arcuate nucleus What is MCrt? Melanocortin This is a neurotransmitter that is released when you feel full/not hungry that leads to the satiety network What are the paraventricular neurons? This neuron transmitter has NPY and will transmit up and release neuro-peptide Y which will activate the paraventricular neurons which when activated will cause you to start feeding/hunger network What does glucose levels have to do with feeding? Glucose receptors in VMN directly inhibit NPY when they become activated Glucose levels will determine the firing rate of the neuron in the ventral medialnucleus This can inactivate the NPY neurons if you don't need to feed and have a lot of blood glucose What is Ghrelin?

Nicotinic receptor blocker This causes the skeletal muscle and NMJ to block voluntary movement Can be used for muscle relaxants (curariform drugs)Explain how muscle contract using myosin and actin? They are very regulated and overlapping When there is contraction, the sacromere shrotens during contraction. The actin and myosin do not change in length but rather slide past each other This is done by the myosin head (dimer) on the M-line which has a binding site for the actin and ATP (as ATPase)Describe the thi c k myofilament The balls are the actin molecules Each actin molecule has a binding site for myosin The binding with the myosin head normally does not occur unless there is Calcium It is two polymerase/chains wound up together Describe troponin and tropomyosin's actions: No calcium: troponin holds tropomyosin over myosin binding sites on actin. No crossbridges form betwen actin and myosin, muscle relaxed When calcium present: Binds to troponin, causing movement of troponin, causing movement of tropomyosin, exposing binding sites for myosin on actin. Crossbridges form between actin and myosin. Cycle occurs, muscle contracts What is the crossbirdge cycle? What is the steps of excitation-contraction coupling?1) Somatic motor neuron releases ACh, a neuromuscular junction2) Net entry of Na+ through ACh receptor-channel initiates a muscle action potential3) Action potential in t-tubule alters conformation of DHP (dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel) receptor4) DHP receptor opens Ry R (ryanodine receptor channel) Ca++ release channels in sacroplasmic reticulum, and Ca++ enters cytoplasm5) Ca++ binds to troposin allowing actin-myosin binding6) Myosin heads execute power stroke What is twitch contraction? A muscle twitch is a single contraction-relaxation cycle Rise-time and duration of twitch force varies with muscle fiber type (fast glycolytic fibers have a rise time of about 50ms and duration of 120ms)To generate force, you need to have many twitches working together There are three periods/phases to twitch contraction:1) Latent period - motor neuron already excited but yet not generating any force where AP is traveling down tubules and requires time for Ca to be released2) Contraction phase - cross-bridge occurs and allows muscle to produce force increasing in tension (steady increase in tension till reach max)3) Relaxation phase - generating less tension and Ca get pumped back into SR where fewer and fewer cross-bridges are allowed to interact with actin-myosin How can summation lead to tetanus? As you increase frequency of AP, the response of all the twitches, they will respond by fusing into one continual contractile contraction called tetanus to generate maximum isometric force Summation can lead to unfused tetanus where stimuli are far enough apart to allow muscle to relax slightly between stimuli Summation can lead to complete tetanus where muscle reaches steady tension and if muscle fatigues, tension decreases rapidly What are smooth muscles? Found in internal organs and blood vessels Not arranged in sacromeres Under involuntary control by ANSMust operate over a range of lengths Layers may run in several directions Contracts and relaxes much more slowly Uses less energy Sustains contraction for extended periods They can be classified by location (vascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, respiratory, reproductive, ocular) or communication with neighbouring cells (single-unit, visceral, multi-unit)What is a single-unit smooth muscle?

Peptide/protein (3 or more amino acids, most common)Steroid (derived from cholesterol)amine (derived from single amino acids)What are peptide/protein hormones? They are the most common type of hormone Made in advance Synthesized like secreted proteins Stored in vesicles Release by exocytosis upon a signal (released on demand, released by Ca+ hormones)Water soluble (dissolved in plasma, hydrophilic which means not cross cell membrane which means acts at cell membrane)Short half life (because protein released into the blood and seeks and broken down, unstable and when binds to receptors, they are internalized and digesting after one use)Bind to membrane receptors What are the three parts of peptide/protein hormone production? All protein/peptide hormones are coded by genes1) Signal sequence Tell you where to go and then dropped off Genes are transcribed into m RNA, translated in cytosol and ribosome detects the ER signal sequence2) Prohormone Signal sequence gets cleaved, hormone will get transported to Golgi complex to get modified Gets stored into a secretory vesicle which leads to sorting/peptide fragment3) Sorting/peptide fragment Get separated from peptide fragment into two components Not always the case but often What are some of the active hormones does the prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) process to? ACTH (involved in cortosil production)Gamma lipotropin Beta endorphin What is alpha-MSH involved in and what does MSH stand for? Apetite (inhibit food intake) and skin activating melanocytes Melanocyte stimulating hormone What is beta-lipotropin involved in? Pain relief POMC production is inhibited by Factor A. POMC produces proteins that increase skin pigmentation which darkens skin, increase blood sugar, relieve pain and decreases appetite. The gland that produces Factor A s no longer working in John. What might we see happen to John? Darkening of skin Outside measuring a lot of ACTH, how can you tell if there is a lot of ACTH? If you see a lot of ACTH, you would see a lot of alpha-MSHIn this system, what would happens if you shut down the pituitary gland? There will be an increase of CRHIn this system, what would happen if you take away glucocorticoids? Increase/a lot of ACTH and CRH as there is no inhibition How are two mature insulin peptide chains bonded? By disulphide bonds For insulin, what is C-peptide? The \\\"inactive\\\" fragment that is cleaved from proinsulin Insulin is degraded in the body extremely quickly and is difficult to measure because of this. How else could we indirectly measure insulin release? Measure C-peptide levels Can be argued to measure preproinsulin peptides but that would be difficult to do in humans What are steroid hormones? Synthesized only from cholesterol Made on demand Released from cell by simple diffusion Water insoluble (bounds to carriers in blood)Long half-life Binds to cytoplasm or nucleus receptors (but in some cases, also act on plasma membrane receptors)What is the starting molecule of aldosterone, cortisol, estriol, etc...? Cholesterol When one of the transforming enzymes is blocked, that specific hormone product cannot be produced and something else will be produced What is aldosterone important for? Sodium pretention What does aldosterone synthease do? Turns corticosterone to aldosterone Seen in the adrenal gland How do you determine which hormone is produced? It is dependent on the cell type as the cell type will express the enzyme of interest The 21-alpha-hydroxyalase enzyme is no longer working in John. What may you see happen in this person? Increased production of androgens What are amine hormones? Synthesized only from tryptophan or tyrosine Example of tryptophan derivative:- Melatonin (behaves like peptides or steroids)Examples of tyrosine derivatives:- Catecholamines (behave like peptides, water soluble, have membrane receptors, can act as neurotransmitters)- Thyroid hormones (behave like steroids, diffuse into cells, carrier proteins in blood that are long lasting)What is melatonin? Darkness hormone Secreted at night (Sleep)Made in pineal gland (also gi tract, leukocytes, other brain regions)Receives light information from eyes Diverse effects:- Transmits information (light-dark cycles to govern biological clock)- Immune modulation- Anti-oxidant Where does the synthesis of catecholamines taken place? Synthesized in adrenal medulla (mainly in cytosol)Stored in vesicles prior to release (released in adrenal gland)Explain the glucose stimulation of insulin release:1) High concentration of glucose transported into the pancreatic beta cell which triggers glycolysis and cellular respiration2) ATP is made since glucose is coming into the cell3) ATP binds to K channel, causing it to close4) More positive charge builds up, causing depolarization, triggering opening of calcium channels causing calcium to come into cell5) The calcium acts on stored vesicles and releases insulin (triggers exocytosis of vesicles)Glucose that enters beta cells cause the release of insulin by increasing cellular ATP levels which close K-ATP sensitive channels. This leads to cell depolarization and opening of voltage gated channels. An insulin causes body wide uptake of glucose, what is this an example of? Negative feedback Sulfonylurea blocks K_ATP channels, what effect would this have? A) Keeps voltage-gated Ca2+ channels closed B) Enhances insulin secretion C) Cause the cell to hyperpolarize D) Directly reduces the levels of ATP in the cell B) Enhances insulin secretion In the anterior pituitary, what are portal vessels? Carry the trophic hormones directly to the anterior pituitary What are endocrine cells? They release their hormones into the second set of capillaries for distribution to the rest of the body What do GHRH target and what hormone does it effect? GHRH = GH releasing Hromone Target cell: Somatotrope Causes stimulation of GHWhat do SRIF (Somatostatin) target and what hormone does it affect? Target cell: Somatotrope Causes inhibition of GHORTarget cell: Thyrotrope Causes inhibition of TSHWhat do Dopamine target and what hormone does it affect? Target: Lactotrope Causes inhibition of PRLWhat does TRH target and what hormone does it affect? TRH = Thyrotropin releasing hormone Target cell: Lactotrope Causes stimulation of PRLORTarget cell: Thyrotrope Causes stimulation of TSHWhat does Gn RH target and what hormone does it affect? Gn RH = Gonadotropin releasing hormone Target cell: Gonadotropes Causes stimulation of FSH and LHWhat does CRH target and what hormone does it affect? CRH = Corticotropin Rel. Hormone Target cell: Corticotrope Causes timulation of ACTHWhen Vasopressin (ADH) is released at nerve terminals, what is the target tissue? Kidney, vasculature When Oxytocin is released at nerve terminals, what is the target tissue? Mammary gland, uterus What determines the amount of active hormone in the plasma? Hormone being release, its going into blood, going to bind to carriers and diffuse off of carriers into target cells Depends on pre-hormone concentration and number of receptors present on target cell Hormones is going to be metabolized as go through liver and kidney (by excretion in urine)How are hormones detected/measured? Hormones are exceptionally potent chemicals (nanomolar to picomolar)Hormone measurements (sensitive method): immunoassay and immunohistochemistry Both use antibodies that specifically bind to part of the hormone What is immunoassay? Tagged antibody specific to hormone (detection in blood and urine)Use antibodies that specifically bind to part of the hormone What is immunohistochemistry Detection in tissue Use antibodies that specifically bind to part of the hormone How do hormones signal? Hormone binds to receptor (primary ligand, agonist, antagonist)Changes the conformation and activity of the receptor Alters activity of intracellular signaling pathways Leads to change in synthesis of target proteins and/or modification of existing target proteins There can be hydrophobic hormones where binds to both intracellular and membrane receptors There can be hydrophilic hormones which are water soluble hormones that bind to plasma membrane receptors What are the properties of hormone receptors? High affinity (strong interaction for binding of receptor and hormone)Saturable (can reach a point where all receptors are bounded to a hormone)Specific (if receptor is modified, than the ligand will have less affinity to the receptor or won't bind at all)Reversible (binding is reversible, no covalent interactions, hormones can dissociate from the receptor)Hormone A binds to receptor B which causes response C. The concentration of hormone A doubles in the body causing a doubling in response C. The concentration of hormone A doubles again, but this time no change in response C. What could be happening? Receptor B is saturated What are the two main types of hormone receptors? Intracellular receptors (bind lipid soluble hormones)Plasma membrane receptors Explain how intracellular receptors work:1) Hydrophobic hormone will diffuse into the cell and bind to either cytoplasmic receptor (exposing a nuclear localization signal on receptor and goes into nucleus) or onto a nuclear receptor2) Bind to HRE (a specific DNA sequence that recognizes the complex but remember, some genes don't have HRE)3) Complex would act as a gene regulatory protein, having some effect on transcription of a subset of genes found in nucleus)End result is a decrease or increase in transcription and increase or decrease in protein production What are HRE? Hormone response elements They are specific DNA sequences that will increase or decrease gene transcription Sometimes receptors recruit co-repressors to inhibit transcription Only genes with the response elements will be activated/repressed What is the most common type of hormone receptor? GPCRWhat is G_as? It is a stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit What is G_ai? An inhibitor G-protein alpha subunit What is G_aq? A phosphorator G-protein alpha subunit How does G_as activate adenyly cyclase?1) When hormone binds to receptor, it causes change in the receptor and causes alpha subunit of G-protein to change its conformation2) When that happens, GDP binds to the alpha subunit in exchange for GTP (so GDP falls off, GTP binds)3) When that happens, the beta and gamma subunits dissociates from the alpha subunit (now just left with alpha subunit)4) The alpha subunit then interacts with adenylate cyclase (in this case) which converts ATP into c AMP (cyclic AMP)5) That then binds to the enzyme Protein kinase A which uses specific substrates (proteins found in cell) and phosphorylates it6) When proteins are phosphorylated, it changes its shape and hence it changes its activity and creates response What is an advantage of using a G-protein receptor? You don't have to have very much of a hormone to have an amplification effect G-protein activates the adenylyl cyclase BUT it can make lots of c AMPLots of c AMP can be made which then binds to many protein kinase A which acts on different substrates Describe c AMP formation and breakdown: Formation: Of ATP, two phosphates are cut of to create a cyclic structure called c AMPBreakdown: c AMP phosphodiesterase breaks the bond to create 5' AMP, turning off hormone signaling What is c AMP phosphodiesterase? It breaks the bond of c AMP to create 5' AMPHow does G_aq activate phospholipase C?1) Signal molecule activates receptor and associated G-protein2) G-protein activates phospholipase C (PL-C), an amplifier enzyme3) PL-C converts membrane phospholipids into diacylgycerol (DAG) which remains in the membrane, and IP3, which diffuses into the cytoplasm4) DAG activates protein kinase C (PK-C) which phosphorylates protein5) IP3 causes release of Ca++ from organelles, creating a Ca++ signal What is the fight or flight response in the liver, fat, heart, skeletal muscles/blood vessels, and intestine/skin/kidney? Liver: glucose release Fat: fatty acid release Heart: muscle contraction Skeletal muscle/blood vessels: Less vasoconstriction, less blood to artery Intestine/skin/kidney: vasoconstriction What adrenergic receptors would you use if you want your arteries to dilate? Beta-1Beta-2What adrenergic receptors would you want to use if you want your arteries to constrict? Alpha-2What happens when a specific hormone binds to a beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptor?

By SHEPHERD HOODWINChanneling is a means of communicating with any consciousness that is not in human form by allowing that consciousness to express itself through the channel (or channeler). We live in a multidimensional universe. Michael teaches that the physical plane is only the first (and most dense) of seven planes. The next plane is the astral; we dwell on the lower astral plane before birth and after death. The other planes are the causal, akashic, mental, messianic, and buddhaic. The planes are discussed in detail in the article, \\\" Planes of Existence .\\\" For now, let's just say that these planes aren't really separate from our lives here on the physical plane. Through channeling, we can make conscious contact with higher planes. We can also communicate with beings who are physical but nonhuman, such as devas (nature spirits), dolphins and whales, and extraterrestrials. Most commonly, the term channeling refers to communication with spirit guides, who are astral, and with high-plane teachers, such as Michael, who are on planes above the astral. (Michael is on the causal plane.) Although the universe contains an infinite variety of consciousness that could theoretically be channeled, in practice channels usually tune in to that with which they have a meaningful connection and which is well-suited to the channeling process. The most common form of communication with nonphysical consciousness is with people who have passed on, but that is usually referred to as \\\"mediumship\\\" rather than channeling. (The Whoopi Goldberg character in the movie Ghost was a medium.) Although there is overlap, channeling usually refers to accessing higher knowledge in order to support spiritual growth and to gain greater clarity about one's life. For instance, my clients often ask Michael about what's going on \\\"behind the scenes\\\" in a problematic relationship. Michael may give information about past-life connections, karmas, agreements, and larger issues being worked on by both parties, providing a \\\"soul's-eye\\\" view of that relationship's dynamic. This can be very useful, and is not the sort of information normally available from a therapist or counselor, although if a person is seeing a therapist, working with Michael as well can be complementary. A medium, as defined here, might also provide this kind of information, but the intent in seeing a medium is usually to communicate with a specific person who has passed on who would not necessarily be expert in accessing such information. Although those on the astral plane are generally more objective about physical experience than we are here on the physical plane, being nonphysical doesn't automatically make someone skillful, knowledgeable, wise, or loving; every consciousness must earn its \\\"enlightenment. \\\"There is much about the process of spiritual channeling that is unknown or difficult to put into words, and each experience of it is unique, but some generalizations can be made. Channeling occurs through what Michael calls the \\\"higher centers,\\\" which are dormant in most of us but which can be opened with practice. Higher centers are the parts of us that can connect with universal love, truth, and kinetic energy. They are like radios that can be tuned in to the frequency of the channeled entity. The \\\"signal\\\" is generally received first by the crown chakra. In verbal channeling, it then stimulates the sixth chakra (the third eye) and the brain, searching the subconscious for correlating words. Either the entity, the channel, or both, working together in cooperation, select the specific words that seem to best express the thoughts. Even if the entity selects the words, the channel doesn't usually experience this as hearing external voices; it has the sound of his own thoughts, since channeled entities do not have physical voices. This is not unlike the process by which we translate our own thoughts into words, except that it is more difficult, because someone else's thoughts are being translated through the channel. By definition, teachers from higher planes work more with the invisible aspects of things, and come at information differently than we do. They often seem to \\\"spiral in\\\" to core insights, gradually unveiling one layer after another, like peeling an onion, rather than coming up with an instant analysis of what is occurring. This is a delicate process, an art as well as a science. Some people channel or at least \\\"tune in\\\" to higher sources without being aware of it. They assume that the thoughts they are having are their own when that is not totally the case. This can account for several people coming up with a similar invention or song, for instance, at the same time--a higher-plane source is trying to get his idea to the physical plane and works with several people simultaneously, perhaps hoping that at least one of them will make it available to others. Not all inspiration comes from channeling, since we are each creative beings in our own right, but most creation involves some kind of collaboration. We receive more help than we realize. My original impression was that channeling is a simple matter of dictation--that if Michael wishes to communicate something, it should sound the same no matter who the channel is. However, experience has taught me that channeling is a much more complex phenomenon. I now see it as a collaboration, with many variables. Being physical, we lack the \\\"equipment\\\" to fully and truly understand what is not physical. We necessarily work with \\\"two-dimensional\\\" intellectual models. They can be helpful, but they cannot replace direct, \\\"three-dimensional\\\" experience, and some direct experience is simply not available to us now. Until we ourselves are nonphysical, we will not be able to fully comprehend how spiritual channeling really works, who or what Michael actually is, and many other things. Even regarding physical phenomena, science purports to explain many things that are not truly understood. Do we really comprehend photosynthesis, for example? We may appreciate an explanation of the mechanics, which may or may not be fairly accurate--science is always changing its mind--but surely that is not the whole picture. It is good to maintain a healthy appreciation of mystery. I am not suggesting blind faith or belief, but an awareness of the vastness of life. WHO CAN CHANNEL? Channeling is similar to playing piano: almost anyone who applies himself can probably learn to do it, at least a little, and even a casual study of it can be enriching. However, learning to do it well requires a lot of energy and commitment, and obviously, it comes more easily to some people than to others. Furthering our skills in this lifetime, whatever they are, can lead to being born with more \\\"talent\\\" in those areas in future lifetimes. We plan each lifetime before it begins. If we desire to channel during that lifetime, we usually make agreements to do so with the particular source (s) we wish to channel, and plan the timing and the form of the channeling we will do so that it supports our life task. We can design our overleaves and even our body to facilitate channeling. Some channels have idiosyncratic bodies for this reason. Not every--one who channels planned to do so before his lifetime began, but someone is not likely to be motivated to invest the energy to learn to channel well unless channeling fits somehow in his life plan. Channeling is usually not of strong interest to the soul until the mature and old soul ages, because before that, our lessons emphasize external factors. If channeling is part of someone's life plan, much preparation may occur on both conscious and unconscious levels during the channel's lifetime before he begins to channel. Not coincidentally, I began channeling shortly after completing a year of intense emotional catharsis and healing, working with someone who was both a therapist and a psychic--I needed to empty my \\\"vessel\\\" of old baggage before I could become a clear channel. According to my channeling, the channels who first brought the basics of the Michael teachings to the public through the Yarbro books studied extensively with Michael on the astral plane to prepare themselves before incarnating. They also set up their lifetimes to do a particular kind of spiritual channeling, focused in the intellectual center, allowing them to bring through highly concentrated, precise material. In addition, several members of the first Michael group had previously studied the Gurdjieff teachings, which use some ideas and terminology similar to some of those in the Michael teachings. (Michael has been channeled as saying that Gurdjieff was also one of their channels, although he was likely channeling unconsciously.) However, the majority of the material was wholly original, and even when Michael \\\"recycled\\\" from Gurdjieff, they often altered the material and used it in new ways. The work of the first Michael channels was remarkable--I doubt that I could have done what they did. Of course, because they did it, I don't have to; I can have a channeling practice suited to my life task, and still have the benefit of the material they generated. I am what has been called a \\\"heart channel\\\"--the heart is where integration occurs. I set it up in my life plan to do channeling that incorporates words, energy, and sometimes emotion to help others not only have intellectual clarity, but to integrate what is being discussed into all levels of self. My practice is not so much informational as experiential. Every approach to channeling has pros and cons. Even though I am careful to allow through the precise words Michael wants, the intellectual side of my channeling is probably somewhat diluted because of the other elements coming through me at the same time, particularly the energy work. The question arises as to who can channel Michael. In Messages from Michael, Michael was quoted as saying, \\\"We are an ancient entity that comes to all who ask.\\\" However, Michael's People states that Michael is not being channeled by priests, and lists a few locations as those of the sole Michael groups. I believe that this referred only to the particular fragments of Michael working with that group, not to the whole of Michael. No doubt there have been priests and people in other locations who have \\\"asked.\\\" (I know a couple of priests who channel or have channeled Michael.) Yarbro also mentioned certain factors that facilitate channeling, such as particular overleaves, being an old soul, and being in six or seven cadence positions (discussed in the following subchapter). However, none of these things are \\\"required.\\\" Michael might be able to penetrate more deeply and powerfully, with a larger perspective, through a channel more ideally suited for channeling them. However, the quote above from Messages suggests that they would welcome anyone who sincerely desires to make conscious contact with them. In the elegant way the universe works, someone who is not suited for channeling Michael will probably not be strongly interested in doing it anyway. I offer a service I call \\\"channeling coaching\\\" for those who are learning to channel and need support and encouragement. In most cases, they don't really need me--they are already making the connection, but they don't trust it. I help them validate it. I also guide them through the process a step at a time, offering pointers and telling them what I'm seeing or being told by their guides. When beginning, I suggest that they ask for the highest, most appropriate source for them to channel now. It may be Michael, but often it isn't--it may be easier to channel their essence or an astral spirit guide first. They may find that channeling from the astral plane is their \\\"niche,\\\" what they agreed to do, or what is most appropriate and comfortable for them. They may also eventually channel a higher-plane source other than Michael. The key for those learning to channel is simply to practice a lot, taking everything they get with a grain of salt without worrying too much about accuracy. It's like sketching in an art class, not being concerned about a final product at that stage. WHAT CHANNELED ENTITIES SEEEinstein taught that physical matter cannot be destroyed, only transformed into energy, just as energy can be transformed into matter. I would take that further and say that matter, and, in fact, everything in the universe, on every plane of existence, is energy. We perceive matter as such because it vibrates in the same portion of the energy spectrum we do. Channeled entities do not perceive physical matter in the same way we do except when they are being channeled and have the use of physical eyes, ears, and so forth. Otherwise, they perceive energy in the way they normally would on their plane of existence, just as psychics see higher planes in terms of the physical plane, since human beings have no means to directly perceive higher planes. The substance of physical life is matter, the substance of astral life is emotion, and the substance of causal life is intellect. Although this is an oversimplification, it could be said that those on the astral plane perceive the physical plane in terms of its emotional substance, and those on the causal plane, in terms of its intellectual substance. I feel a bond with the soul who was George Gershwin. (We are in the same entity.) I saw Porgy and Bess at the Metropolitan Opera a few years ago, and mentally communicated with him about it. I thought that it was a poor production, and was surprised when he said that it was exactly what he had had in mind. Later, I realized that he was mainly perceiving the astral (or emotional energy) component of it. From his vantage point, he could probably not tell too much about the acting or the appropriateness of the casting. Therefore, he probably wasn't in a position to critically appraise the production, although what he was able to perceive--perhaps including the feeling of the music if not the precise physical sound--pleased him. (Also, he had originally planned for the Met to premiere it, and decided on a Broadway run instead in order to give it more exposure, so a Met production was probably gratifying.) Now, when I see a theatrical production with his music, I usually channel him so that he can see it physically rather than astrally. When I \\\"took him\\\" to the Broadway musical Crazy for You, he told me to get better seats next time--he would pay for them! (I was in the balcony. )In 1983, I wrote narration for, directed, and sang in a musical review for the local community theater in Loveland, Colorado, where I was living at the time. A friend who is metaphysically inclined came to see it. She is normally unemotional and objective, but she cried throughout it, and thought that everything I did was absolutely wonderful (which was probably not objectively the case!). At the end, she heard herself thinking, \\\"Now I can pass on.\\\" She realized that she had been channeling my mother, who had continued to feel responsible for raising me. Being channeled, she could more directly look in on my physical well-being and see that I was safely on my path. This freed her to go on to other things. I was twenty-eight at the time, which astrologically is the time of the \\\"Saturn return,\\\" in a sense the beginning of adulthood. In terms of the Michael teachings, I was also moving in soul age from sixth- to seventh-level old, and I had just begun a career as a stockbroker (after substitute teaching and operating my own singing telegram business), so it was a time of major transition for me. It makes sense that my mother would have felt that she could relinquish responsibility for my well-being at that juncture. She didn't actually need to be channeled in order to \\\"see\\\" me, but what she saw from the astral plane when she wasn't being channeled was an astral rendering, a fluid astral \\\"picture\\\" of my feelings and thoughts, rather than a precise view of the details of my day-to-day life. Had she tried to stay close enough to my physical reality to continually perceive it in a physical-like way, it would have kept her earthbound, a prisoner of the life she needed to leave behind. Certainly she had been aware of me, and had offered whatever help she could, ever since her passing. A few months after it, I was at summer camp (I was eight), lying in my bunk trying to go to sleep, but I couldn't. Bedtime was eight p.m., and it was already eleven. My main thought was how tired I would be the next day. Then she appeared to me in a vision that reminded me in its vividness of looking through a View-Master (a toy through which one looked at intensely colored slides). With her was someone who I thought was Moses, but who was probably one of her guides (or one of mine). When I blinked, they were still there. I didn't hear any words, but she made a gesture that communicated that everything would be all right. This kind of transmission takes a great deal of effort; the reason I couldn't sleep for those three hours was probably that they were trying to get through all that time. Incidentally, before she passed on, when she unconsciously knew that she was dying, she painted a painting with a symbolic message to me about her death; the canvas was found unfinished in the trunk of her car after her death. She was also a singer, and left behind a tape recording of herself singing a lullaby with the words, \\\"Don't you cry. Mama won't go away.\\u2026Even when you're a great big man, Mama won't go away. \\\"PREDICTIONSSince the future, by definition, hasn't happened yet, it is impossible to make consistently accurate predictions. Some psychics and channeled sources are adept at picking up probabilities based on where things are heading, but since each individual has free will--probabilities are constantly shifting as we make choices--nobody knows for sure. Even when certain changes are more or less inevitable, the form they take and the way people react to them are not. Timing is especially difficult to predict, and even when different channels and psychics agree in their predictions about specific events, the dates often vary. Sometimes people tell me that a psychic or a channeled entity told them that something terrible was going to happen, which upset them a great deal. That strikes me as inappropriate. I'm not suggesting that someone should lie if he sees a strong negative probability on the horizon, but it should be conveyed in such a way as to empower the person listening. Michael doesn't give \\\"bad news.\\\" If they see someone creating a situation that he probably won't like, their approach might be to show him how he can create a more pleasing situation instead, if he's interested. Besides, since nothing is carved in stone before it happens, it is misleading to say that something is definitely, without a doubt, going to happen. Furthermore, because Michael's point of view is neutral, they may see what someone else might call \\\"bad news\\\" in a different light--for example, they might see a probable outcome as being simply another of the physical plane's growth-promoting challenges. Their approach may then be to show a client how he can make the best of that outcome if it arises. It is wise to take predictions with a grain of salt. Rather than asking if and when an event will happen, it might be more useful to ask what percentage the probability is, and if there are agreements or karmas putting force behind its happening. For example, at a given moment, a person might have a sixty-two percent probability of getting a particular job, and the employer might have an essence-level agreement with him to hire him. That is a very high probability, since probabilities rarely rise to about eighty-five percent until something is actually in the process of happening; even a fifty percent probability is quite high. Nonetheless, people don't always keep their agreements, for a variety of reasons, and the person may not be hired. If, unexpectedly, someone comes along who seems better qualified or who is a friend of the company's owner, the probability might drop to thirty-seven percent, which is still fairly high, but, obviously, not overwhelming. If we have an agreement to meet someone at a certain time, we may not be able to keep the \\\"appointment,\\\" but if it's an important agreement, chances are that we will reschedule it and it will eventually work out. This is an organic, ever-changing world. Nothing is carved in stone. Every significant choice a person makes can change relevant probabilities. (NOTE: Indented passages are excerpts from my channeling of Michael. )We do not know for a certainty what the future will bring for ourselves or for you. That makes the game of life much more interesting and challenging. If everything could be predicted ahead of time, we would all have to be automatons, and if we are expressions of the Tao, then the Tao would likewise be an automaton. Fortunately, this is not the case. We cannot predict what others will do with assurance because others themselves do not know what they will do, and even if they think they know, they might change their minds. We can only give our best projections based on where things appear to be going, taking into account the relevant agreements and karmas. This is an art we are learning. Imminent events are easier to predict. If an object is teetering precariously on the edge of a shelf, one could safely predict that it will fall. However, even in such a situation, someone might come along and move it. It is a great fallacy that you need to predict the future to choose well now. Relying on predictions of the future weakens your capacity to make good choices. When you think that you have everything figured out, you may start to drift by on your preconceived notions rather than playing the game in the present moment with all the skill and attention you can muster. Even if events do not go as our essence planned and predictions therefore prove wrong, sometimes things work out for the best anyway. A case in point was my apartment when I lived in Manhattan. Affordable apartments were next to impossible to find when I moved there, especially those larger than one-bedroom. However, my guides told me that I would find an inexpensive two-bedroom apartment to share. I got a photographic image of it, and a couple of my friends psychically saw similar images. Apparently, my guides were working on a few possible apartments that fit that description, but all of them fell through. I still found an affordable apartment, but it was a studio. It had been one of my guides' \\\"back-up\\\" choices, but they hadn't told me about it ahead of time. It was disappointing at first, but it turned out to suit my needs better in some respects than the envisioned apartment likely would have. I don't subscribe to the idea that everything works out for the best--the highest outworkings are sometimes thwarted because, again, people have free will--but I do believe that the universe is basically benevolent, and as a whole conspires to our highest good if we let it. Perhaps sometimes it does so in ways of which even our guides and essence are not aware. WE ARE RESPONSIBLENo one on any plane of existence is infallible or knows everything we need to know. In addition, we all have our own experience of reality and ways of describing it. There is no right and wrong in this regard, only infinite facets of truth. We do have much to learn from each other, and those on higher planes usually have more experience, greater resources of information, and a larger perspective than we do on the physical plane. However, their counsel is more accurately viewed as coming from loving friends than from a deity. No one is more \\\"God\\\" than anyone else. We are each responsible for ourselves. We experience more growth if we don't do things merely because we think someone else, incarnate or not, told us to. It is well to examine what we hear others say with appreciation and respect, but we don't always hear what is actually meant, for one thing. More importantly, no one knows us better than we know ourselves, at least potentially. We must make our own decisions and mistakes, and form our own understanding, if we are to learn to guide the course of our lives wisely. Besides, true teachers don't tell people what to do. They give greater perspective and understanding so that their students can make well-informed choices. Beware of those who issue orders, or who are certain that they know what's best for someone else, even if they are being channeled from a higher plane. Just because material is channeled does not mean that it is appropriate or a fully realized expression of truth. RECOGNIZING TRUTHChanneled material, like everything else, must be interpreted through the understanding of the hearer. Sometimes we draw conclusions or make associations that are not valid, or we simply misunderstand. I am sometimes amazed at what clients say Michael said. The truth is precise; it is as important to hear what is not being said as what is. The ability to recognize truth is crucial. Truth is always associated with love. It has a certain feel about it. It is not necessarily comfortable, but it is penetrating and ultimately liberating. Often the truth or value of channeled material isn't fully apparent until later. It may seem at first to be deceptively simple or general. If we have that experience with something channeled for us, we have nothing to lose by living with it a while and seeing if it looks different later. One client told me that after her session, she wasn't particularly impressed, but two months later, she listened to her tapes and couldn't believe that Michael had said what they did; it was almost as if she hadn't heard it the first time. This is a common reaction. In my brochure for new clients, Michael says: You will get the most out of this session if you review the material in a week or two. It's hard for so much new input to soak in the first time. A defense against overload is to make it seem less than it is. This is normal, but often, our students find their channeling to be far more meaningful weeks or even months later. It is the mark of a good teacher (and we aspire to this) to give what the student is almost but not quite ready to hear. That way, we promote growth. Obviously, the material becomes more meaningful when the student is actually ready. Our Western society's model of truth is based on polarity: something is either true or it isn't, and if it's true, something else must therefore be false. In my experience, two statements that seem contradictory can both be true, or at least, mostly true. I have sought to demonstrate that throughout this book. Michael speaks of personal, world, and universal truths. That concept points out that something may be true for an individual or even many individuals, but not be true for everyone in the world, let alone in the universe. Gravity, for instance, is different everywhere on the planet, partly because of varying distances from the earth's core. If we didn't know that and saw two different measurements of earth's gravity reported, we would probably assume that one report was wrong. When we don't have enough information, when we lack \\\"bridge information,\\\" we can tend to be judgmental and simplistic in our views. Truth is infinite, and is therefore vast enough to hold an infinite number of facets. Someone said that the measure of an idea's greatness is the degree to which its opposite is also true. If there are poles of absolute truth and absolute falsehood, there is a long continuum in between, the infinite shades of gray between white and black. But more likely, absolute truth and absolute falsehood do not exist in the dimensional universe--only in the Tao is absolute truth. Pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, refuses to be rounded off--it just keeps going into infinity: 3.14159265\\u2026. We do round off pi so that we can work with it--that is a convenience, but it is not the whole truth. With any spiritual teaching, we are working with rounded-off truth, because we cannot work directly with the whole truth--it's too big. I discussed models of reality in the Preface. We have no choice but to work with models. What else do we have? However, a good model connects us to the infinite truth that it models, and although that cannot be fathomed, it can be felt. The more true we are to the truth of ourselves, the better we can recognize truth in models. THE LARGER PERSPECTIVEWe are in the midst of a planetary transformation. There are many nonphysical beings who are assisting with it, whether we know it or not. Channeling is a means of consciously working with them. They are often as gratified to make the connection with us as we are with them. Used in a responsible way, channeling can be an important tool in our personal and collective growth. Whether or not we call ourselves channels, it is becoming more and more essential that each of us develop our inner connections with the larger universe if we are to move creatively with the changes occurring.

Home & Garden Outdoor Q: How much does a new asphalt driveway cost? A: Quick Answer The cost of a new asphalt driveway depends on the size of the driveway, but on average costs $3 to $4 per square foot. Nationally, most homeowners spend between $3,447 and $4,919 on a new asphalt driveway, as of 2014. Continue Reading Keep Learning What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway? What are some tips for fixing an asphalt driveway? What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway per square foot? Full Answer Only a local contractor can give you the exact cost of a new asphalt driveway. Prices vary by geographical location and are subject to change year to year, based on the cost of raw materials, government regulations, demand and labor charges. Asphalt cost is based on a \\\"per ton\\\" basis. Added to this is the cost of crew and machinery used, in addition to other miscellaneous costs. The depth of the asphalt and quality of the preparation also factor into the final cost of the driveway. A reputable contractor digs a base of 4 to 6 inches for a new driveway, adds driveway gravel, grades the surface properly, and lays 3 to 4 inches of base asphalt, followed by another 1 to 2 inches of topcoat asphalt. Some unscrupulous contractors try to undercut the competition by quoting lower prices and then skimping on the preparation and using less asphalt, resulting in a driveway that soon cracks and falls apart. A well-constructed and maintained asphalt driveway lasts for 20 years or more.

Before starting any project, it is a good idea to calculate costs to understand the financial impact of the project. This goes double for any home improvements such as asphalting a driveway. If you wait for the contractors to do the estimate, you will just have to take them at their word. Calculating the cost prior to the project will strengthen your price negotiating position. Step 1Measure the area of the driveway to determine how much asphalt you will need for the driveway. It is usually best to add an inch or two of area all the way around to allow for asphalting waste. Step 2Decide how deep the asphalt driveway will be. If you lay the asphalt driveway over an existing driveway, you will need to measure from the top of that surface and add in any filler areas if there are damaged areas in the existing asphalt. However, should you want to completely tear out the existing driveway, you must measure from the ground up. Typically, asphalt driveways are 2 inches deep. Step 3Determine how much a base you will need to install below the asphalt driveway. If you are going to tear out the old driveway, there must be an installation of base material on which the asphalt sits. The base will use slightly less area than the asphalt but will usually be an inch or two deeper. Step 4Choose the type of asphalt you want to use on your driveway. Pure asphalt is more expensive but lasts longer, while recycled asphalt is cheaper but does not wear as well as pure asphalt. If you plan to sell in few years, you may want to opt for the cheaper asphalt, but if you live there any longer, pure asphalt is best. Step 5Call the local materials supply store to determine the price per square foot of asphalt top coating and base. If you are tearing out the existing driveway, you will need to ask for the price per square foot of base stone. Step 6Calculate the cost of asphalting a driveway by multiplying the square foot size of the driveway by the cost of the asphalt and, if necessary, the base stone. Then multiply that number by the depth of the driveway, because the square foot price of asphalt is usually by the inch in depth. Step 7Add in the cost of labor if you are going to pay others to asphalt the driveway. In a do-it-yourself project, you will need to factor in the cost of renting the asphalting equipment. This is the total cost of asphalting a driveway.

Also referred to as blacktop for its coloring, asphalt is made using a combination of stones and sand, bound together with materials left over from the production of fuels like gasoline, diesel and kerosene.

A basic asphalt driveway costs about $2 to $6 per square foot, including installation. That provides you with a base and a top coat. The price goes up from there if you add features like a chip seal top coat, which extends the life of the driveway, or a decorative top coat that is stamped or colored. With those features, you could spend $8 or more per square foot. If you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the asphalt. Asphalt Driveway Pros Price - Asphalt is considerably less expensive than concrete. In some cases, it\\u2019s about half the price. Better in cold climates - Asphalt is less likely to crack in cold weather. It performs better than concrete in very harsh or snowy climates. Snow removal is also easier with asphalt. Won\\u2019t show stains - Because asphalt is generally dark in color, in doesn\\u2019t show oil stains. Easier to repair - Cracks and holes can be filled more easily with asphalt driveways. Asphalt driveways can be repaired or re-layered, while concrete generally needs to be replaced. Asphalt Driveway Cons Shorter lifespan - Asphalt doesn\\u2019t last as long. The lifespan is generally about 15 to 20 years - half that of concrete. More maintenance required - Asphalt needs to be resealed every three to five years, particularly if you want it to last. Oily texture - Asphalt has an oily texture that softens in heat or direct sunlight. If the asphalt gets stuck to your shoes and you track it through the house, it can stain your floors. Rough edges - WIth asphalt, it can be difficult to get a straight, clean edge. Concrete Driveway Overview Concrete is another popular material for driveways, particularly in the south. Cement is mixed with a variety of sand and gravel to create this strong, durable material. How Much Does a Concrete Driveway Cost? Basic, construction-grade concrete costs about $5 to $10 per square foot, including installation. Opting for fancier, decorative versions such as stamped or colored concrete will add several dollars per square foot to the price. Very high-end concrete could cost as much as $15 per square foot. Again, if you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the concrete. Removal of an existing driveway usually runs $50 to $60 per hour. Concrete Driveway Pros Long lasting - Concrete has a long life expectancy. Properly maintained, it can last 30 to 40 years. Low maintenance - Concrete driveways don\\u2019t need to be resealed as often, particularly in mild climates. Better in warm climates - Unlike asphalt, concrete will not soften in hot weather. Concrete Driveway Cons Prone to cracking - Due to frost heaves, concrete will eventually crack in cold climates. It is also susceptible to salt damage. Unlike asphalt, damage to a concrete driveway is difficult - if not impossible - to repair. The driveway usually needs to be replaced. Stains easily - Due to the light color, concrete shows almost every type of stain, particularly oil stains. Price - Concrete is significantly more expensive than asphalt.

Compare free price quotes from multiple companies and save time and money instantly! No obligations to hire or purchase ever!Find a Driveway Pro >>How Much Does an Asphalt Driveway Cost? A basic asphalt driveway costs about $2 to $6 per square foot, including installation. That provides you with a base and a top coat. The price goes up from there if you add features like a chip seal top coat, which extends the life of the driveway, or a decorative top coat that is stamped or colored. With those features, you could spend $8 or more per square foot. If you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the asphalt. Asphalt Driveway Pros Price - Asphalt is considerably less expensive than concrete. In some cases, it\\u2019s about half the price. Better in cold climates - Asphalt is less likely to crack in cold weather. It performs better than concrete in very harsh or snowy climates. Snow removal is also easier with asphalt. Won\\u2019t show stains - Because asphalt is generally dark in color, in doesn\\u2019t show oil stains. Easier to repair - Cracks and holes can be filled more easily with asphalt driveways. Asphalt driveways can be repaired or re-layered, while concrete generally needs to be replaced. Asphalt Driveway Cons Shorter lifespan - Asphalt doesn\\u2019t last as long. The lifespan is generally about 15 to 20 years - half that of concrete. More maintenance required - Asphalt needs to be resealed every three to five years, particularly if you want it to last. Oily texture - Asphalt has an oily texture that softens in heat or direct sunlight. If the asphalt gets stuck to your shoes and you track it through the house, it can stain your floors. Rough edges - WIth asphalt, it can be difficult to get a straight, clean edge. Concrete Driveway Overview Concrete is another popular material for driveways, particularly in the south. Cement is mixed with a variety of sand and gravel to create this strong, durable material. How Much Does a Concrete Driveway Cost? Basic, construction-grade concrete costs about $5 to $10 per square foot, including installation. Opting for fancier, decorative versions such as stamped or colored concrete will add several dollars per square foot to the price. Very high-end concrete could cost as much as $15 per square foot. Again, if you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the concrete. Removal of an existing driveway usually runs $50 to $60 per hour. Concrete Driveway Pros Long lasting - Concrete has a long life expectancy. Properly maintained, it can last 30 to 40 years. Low maintenance - Concrete driveways don\\u2019t need to be resealed as often, particularly in mild climates. Better in warm climates - Unlike asphalt, concrete will not soften in hot weather. Concrete Driveway Cons Prone to cracking - Due to frost heaves, concrete will eventually crack in cold climates. It is also susceptible to salt damage. Unlike asphalt, damage to a concrete driveway is difficult - if not impossible - to repair. The driveway usually needs to be replaced. Stains easily - Due to the light color, concrete shows almost every type of stain, particularly oil stains. Price - Concrete is significantly more expensive than asphalt.

Donovan Frequently I get asked the question by homeowners on whether or not a driveway can be asphalt paved in winter. The answer depends on whether or not the ground is frozen. Simply put, if the ground is frozen do not allow the asphalt paving contractor to apply the asphalt. If it is applied when the ground is frozen it will not roll to grade well. The asphalt arrives on the job site extremely hot allowing it to be easily spread and rolled to grade. Find a local paving contractor here. However, if the hot asphalt is poured onto a frozen surface such as the ground, the asphalt will immediately begin to stiffen or freeze up. Check out this Asphalt Driveway Paving Bid Sheet that will answer many of your questions and help you find the right paving contractor for your project. Even if the asphalt driveway is able to be rolled to grade while the ground is frozen it will result in a poor quality driveway that will quickly begin to break down. The reason for this is the aggregate material embedded in the asphalt will not be firmly packed with the asphalt, thus resulting in stones quickly becoming loose. If, the temperature is below freezing, but the ground has not yet frozen it is acceptable to have the Asphalt paving contractor install the asphalt driveway. Unlike a frozen ground, below freezing air temperatures will not dramatically affect the rate of hardening of the asphalt material. Thus the asphalt paving contractor will be able to roll the asphalt to grade and achieve the right level of compression. To conclude, if you live in the northern half of the United States, and it is already December, it is probably wise to hold off any asphalt paving projects until springtime.

Home & Garden Outdoor Q: How much does a new asphalt driveway cost? A: Quick Answer The cost of a new asphalt driveway depends on the size of the driveway, but on average costs $3 to $4 per square foot. Nationally, most homeowners spend between $3,447 and $4,919 on a new asphalt driveway, as of 2014. Continue Reading Keep Learning What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway? What are some tips for fixing an asphalt driveway? What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway per square foot? Full Answer Only a local contractor can give you the exact cost of a new asphalt driveway. Prices vary by geographical location and are subject to change year to year, based on the cost of raw materials, government regulations, demand and labor charges. Asphalt cost is based on a \\\"per ton\\\" basis. Added to this is the cost of crew and machinery used, in addition to other miscellaneous costs. The depth of the asphalt and quality of the preparation also factor into the final cost of the driveway. A reputable contractor digs a base of 4 to 6 inches for a new driveway, adds driveway gravel, grades the surface properly, and lays 3 to 4 inches of base asphalt, followed by another 1 to 2 inches of topcoat asphalt. Some unscrupulous contractors try to undercut the competition by quoting lower prices and then skimping on the preparation and using less asphalt, resulting in a driveway that soon cracks and falls apart. A well-constructed and maintained asphalt driveway lasts for 20 years or more.

Why are some dealers selling the same tires cheaper than others\\u2014 are they seconds? What is the recommended tread depth to replace tires? Can I mix MX tread patterns on my bike? How do I select the right replacement tires for my motorcycle? Top The only sure way of doing this is to refer to the approved recommendations of a tire manufacturer or your motorcycle owner\\u2019s manual. All reputable tire manufacturers have their own list of approved tires for most motorcycle models. These lists may appear on websites, or in a booklet, and should be available at your motorcycle dealer or parts and accessory shop. Dunlop\\u2019s recommendations are available on our website Dunlopmotorcycle.com and in literature distributed at consumer events and at dealerships. The owner\\u2019s manual will include the original sizes and type of tire. In some cases, an alternative will also be included. Always make sure that the tires recommended for your bike appear in a written form. In other words, don\\u2019t follow someone\\u2019s personal recommendation. It is very important, and one rider\\u2019s preference does not necessarily suit another\\u2019s. Take the advice of the professionals: the motorcycle or tire manufacturer. At what age is a tire no longer usable? Top Service life is dependent on many variables such as inflation pressure, storage, driving conditions, loads, general maintenance and abuse. Scientific or technical data indicate that a specific minimum or maximum service life cannot be objectively established. It is not appropriate to establish an arbitrary tire removal date based on chronological age due to the wide variety of factors affecting a tire\\u2019s service life. Why are some front and rear patterns reversed? What about channeling the water? Top Many Dunlop motorcycle tire patterns have \\u201creversed front patterns\\u201d compared to rear, because different forces act on front and rear tires. We test all Dunlop tires for satisfactory wet performance in the direction as indicated on the sidewall. It is important to always mount the tire in the correct direction of rotation as indicated by the arrow on the sidewall. How can I keep my tires from cupping? Top You may not be able to entirely avoid cupping. Tire cupping or irregular wear is a somewhat common occurrence on all vehicles. On a four-wheel vehicle, you are advised to rotate your tires periodically to even out wear. Unfortunately, you do not have this luxury with a motorcycle because front and rear tires, unlike those on most four-wheel vehicles, are not interchangeable. However, there are steps that can be taken to minimize cupping and uneven wear on a motorcycle: Maintain your motorcycle and particularly your front and suspension. Avoid hard braking whenever possible. Braking causes the tire to grab and wear in one direction. When braking is applied to the front tire, the load transfer over-flexes the tire and increases the tendency for cupping and uneven wear. Maintain your tire pressures. Under inflation and overloading of motorcycle tires are significant causes of cupping and uneven wear, particularly in association with hard braking and/or trailer use. Once a tire begins to show signs of uneven wear, even following these steps may not improve the condition. Tire companies can, and are, helping to minimize cupping and uneven wear but you, the rider, must do your part. Following the aforementioned guidelines will help avoid uneven wear. How much run-in should I give a new tire? Top When new tires are fitted, they should not be subjected to maximum power or hard cornering until a reasonable run-in distance of approximately 100 miles has been achieved. This is necessary for a number of reasons. Replacements for worn tires with different patterns and construction will not react the same. Also, a new tire is stiffer than an old tire. The new tire has a rounder tread profile, different contact patch and \\u201clean-over edge\\u201d than the worn profile of an old tire. The new tire will also not react the same in combination with its remaining tire. Carrying out the required run-in will allow you to become accustomed to the \\u201cfeel\\u201d of the new tires and tire combinations, so you are better able to achieve optimum road grip for use in high speed, high acceleration and handling situations. Should I use nitrogen in my tires? Top Nitrogen is not widely available and provides the same rolling resistance as tires filled with air. Scientific tests on the effect of the use of nitrogen in tires and changes in tire physical properties are inconclusive. In testing, nitrogen tires lost 2/3 as much as air-filled tires, so the benefits are minimal. If you want to maintain the nitrogen, any refills will need to be with nitrogen, not air. That means maintaining your tires becomes less convenient and more costly. The most important tire maintenance function is ensuring correct tire inflation pressure, which is easier using air than nitrogen. Can I change my tires from bias ply to radial or vice versa? Top Bias and radial tires have significantly different dynamic properties. They deflect differently, create different cornering forces, have different damping characteristics, as well as other differences. In order for radial tires to be introduced into the two-wheel market, it was necessary to change certain characteristics of the motorcycle. The introduction of the radial tire led to such things as modified frames, wider wheels, new steering geometries and suspensions. Therefore, it is recommended that a motorcycle be used with the type of tire construction that it came with originally. If a change is to be made, then it should only be done if the motorcycle or tire manufacturer has approved the change. Above all, do not mix bias ply and radial tires on the same motorcycle unless it is with the approval of the motorcycle or tire manufacturer. Can I put wider tires on my motorcycle? Top This is possible in some cases, but again, it should only be done with the approval of the motorcycle or tire manufacturer. When considering wider tires, you must factor in clearance for width and diameter, the effect on stability and handling, along with whether your rim is wide enough. If wider tires are approved for a motorcycle, it is usually permissible to increase by only one size designation. When fitting a larger tire, always allow for some tire growth from the new to used situation. All tires increase in size after they have been inflated and are run for a few hundred miles. In some cases, putting a wider tire onto the same wheel will actually give you less \\u201crubber on the road\\u201d, by changing the profile and reducing the contact patch. Can I use a car tire on the back of my motorcycle? Top No. The design of automotive tires and motorcycle tires are very different. The profile of automotive and motorcycle rims are different with a different bead seating area. An automotive tire will not seat properly on a motorcycle rim, making it more susceptible to problems such as rim slip, which can cause balance problems. Motorcycles are designed specifically with a unique tread profile for leaning over when cornering. Under emergency or extreme maneuvering conditions, an automotive tire on a motorcycle may not allow the bike to handle as it was intended, which can lead to accident, injury or death. Can I put a rear tire on the front or vice-versa? Top Motorcycle tires are designed to work together in front or rear applications due to loading, steering and braking forces. Unless specially designed, you can only use a front on the front and a rear on the rear, following the directional rotation arrows. How often should you change the valve stem or tube? Top Every time you change your tires you should use a new, properly installed valve stem for a tubeless tire or change the tube for a tube type application. I participate in Track Days. What inflation pressure should I use? Top This varies on the model of tire, track conditions and temperature. If tire pressures are adjusted for track use, always remember to reset the inflation pressure back to the recommended street inflation pressure before you leave the track. Why do motorcycle tires wear out so quickly compared to car tires? Top In answering this question, we must first make sure that we are comparing apples to apples. When you think of it, the vast majority of motorcycles are high performance vehicles compared to most cars. Consider that you rarely see a motorcycle with less than \\u201dH\\u201d speed-rated tire. By comparison, the vast majority of cars ride on tires with lower speed ratings. Power-to-weight ratio and speed are big factors with respect to tire wear. Unfortunately, when many people compare mileage, they do so with a family sedan and a much higher-performance motorcycle. Another significant factor in this comparison is the size of the tire contact footprint. In the case of a car, the footprint is much larger and there are four, not two tires contacting the pavement. You must keep in mind that virtually the entire width of the relatively flat tread of a car is in contact with the road all of the time. A car remains upright, even when cornering. This results in a much smaller contact footprint for a motorcycle tire. High power-to-weight ratio, speed, size of footprint and other aspects explain why motorcycle tires wear out quicker than car tires. To obtain the best mileage from your motorcycle tires, observe the following guidelines: obey the speed limit; avoid quick acceleration and hard braking; maintain recommended tire pressures; and do not overload your bike or tow a trailer. What is the best way to clean and protect my tires? Top Use a mild soap solution to clean your sidewalls, white striping or lettering, and rinse off with plain water. Never use protectants, cleaners or dressings to enhance your tire appearance. These may degrade the rubber and remove the inherent ozone cracking/weather checking resistance. What inflation pressure should I use? Top Maintain tire inflation and load in accordance with your motorcycle owner\\u2019s manual, tire information placard and restrictions molded into the tire sidewall. The pressure noted on the sidewall of the tire is a maximum for that tire and may not match the recommended pressure for your motorcycle. So always follow the tire manufacturer\\u2019s or motorcycle manufacturer\\u2019s inflation pressure recommendation. All pressures should be set cold\\u2014that is, before the bike is ridden. Is it normal for my tires to build up additional pressure? Top Yes. Under most riding conditions, the pressure will increase due to heat build-up from the tire and from environmental conditions. This is normal, and the pressure should not be adjusted while the tire is hot. Should I let air out of my tires when they get hot to keep the recommended pressure? Top No. Air expands as it gets warmer and will raise the tire air pressure. Do not adjust the pressure down while the tire is hot or has been ridden recently. How often should I check my tires? Top Checking tires regularly is the most important maintenance function you can perform. At least once a week, and daily when on a trip, check and maintain the correct inflation pressure and visually inspect the tire all the way around for any signs of damage. What type of air gauge is best? Top A good quality gauge that holds its reading, is easy to use and you will use often. Gauges do wear out and should be checked annually to ensure accuracy. Is the D404 an acceptable replacement tire for use on Harley Davidson models? Top The D404 is not meant to be used on Harley Davidson motorcycles. In many cases the D404 does not have the load carrying capacity for use on Harley Davidson motorcycles. Most D404 tires are intended for lighter, cruising motorcycles and are constructed for use on those bikes. D404 tires are bias tires, not bias belted, and do not have additional supporting plies. Motorcycle tires differ from each other in their size, their load carrying capacity, internal construction and the intended type of use. For example, tires for sport riding compared to tires for long distance touring may have different compounds, constructions and tread patterns. Always fit the correct tires to your motorcycle, and for Harley Davidson motorcycles, never fit a D404. How can I get sponsored? Top Off-Road Sponsorship (All Amateurs \\u2013 youth/adult) Submit request for consideration through www. Hookit.com for the appropriate discipline. Canadian residents can now also apply. Why are some dealers selling the same tires cheaper than others\\u2014 are they seconds? Top No. Dunlop does not sell seconds or blemished tires. Dealers are free to set their own pricing. What is the recommended tread depth to replace tires? Top Always remove the tires from service before they reach the treadwear indicator bars (1/32 of an inch tread pattern depth remaining). Worn/unworn tire combinations and worn tires used in wet conditions can result in deteriorated handling and can lead to accident, injury or death. Can I mix MX tread patterns on my bike? Top Yes! Use the different models of tire for different off-road conditions and riding preferences. \",\n          \"Polar Bears Polar Bears Spending the dark winter months in the Arctic circle, polar bears are one of the most highly specialised of all the carnivores, and the largest!Tweet Polar bear with her cubs Classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Ursidae Species: Ursus maritimus Overview Adult male polar bears can weigh up to 460 kilograms but females are much smaller, weighing up to 250 kilograms. A large male can also measure over three metres in length and stand over 1.2 metres in height from ground to shoulder. On average wild polar bears have a lifespan of 20 to 30 years. Habitat The Arctic ice bowl is one of the most harsh and unforgiving environments on earth, and one to which the polar bear is superbly adapted. Winter temperatures can drop to minus 30 degrees centigrade but the bears\\u2019 two layers of fur and underlying blubber help prevent heat loss. Anatomy Polar bears have the same body temperature as humans. They have black skin and transparent, hollow hair which acts like optical fibres, channeling sun light to the black skin where it is absorbed as heat - a fantastic adaptation to a cold environment. Fur between the bears\\u2019 bumpy black footpads and curling claws enable an excellent grip on ice. Behaviour Polar bears are fastidious about keeping their coats clean. Having feasted for 20 minutes they then spend just as long again cleaning themselves up. Size A large male can measure just over three metres in length and stand over 1.2 metres in height from ground to shoulder. If stood on its hind legs it can be as tall as an elephant. Their enormous paws measure up to 32 centimetres across. Female polar bear waiting on the edge of sea ice Hunting They spend most of the time hunting seals, who lie below the surface in their air-holes. Polar bears can detect the smell of a seal\\u2019s lair from up to two kilometres away. They then stomp through the snow and ice and grab the seal before it can escape into the water. However, polar bears can also close their nostrils and hold their breath for two minutes under water, enabling them to sneak up and grab seals laying out on the edges of ice floes. Diet Seals are the mainstay of the polar bear diet and are essential to its survival, but when the going gets tough polar bears will eat seaweed, birds\\u2019 eggs, lichen, berries and young walrus. A male polar bear, hungry from the lean pickings of winter, will even eat its own cubs as they emerge from their snowy dens for the first time. Breeding Polar bear cubs are born in midwinter and emerge from the den in March or April to begin survival lessons through play and imitation of the mother. The usual litter numbers two and more is rare. Weighing little more than half a kilogram and at about 30 centimetres long, cubs survive solely from the warmth of their mother's fur and her rich fatty milk. Two male polar bears fighting Threats The polar bear is at the top of the food chain in its environment. Occasionally, while defending its young, a large bull walrus can wound or kill a polar bear with its tusks. Polar bears rarely kill one another but the males can fight savagely during the brief mating season. The biggest threats are the human hunter, pollution and climate change, although the polar bear is not officially an endangered species. Encounters Jim Mc Neill, Founder and Leader of the Ice Warrior Project had a close encounter with a wild polar bear. One spring day I decided to visit the ancient Thule ruins where the original settlement was situated. In the corner of my eye I was aware of movement and turned to face a big male polar bear rummaging through the waste of the township. There was more movement and I soon realised I was watching a whole load of savaging polar bears \\u2013 I counted 13 in all! This was very unusual behaviour; bears are normally such solitary creatures!In Ontario, Canada, The Polar Bear Conservation & Educational Habitat has a wading pool where visitors can swim with the bears albeit separated by a wall of toughened glass. Quick Facts Inuits call polar bears \\\"Nanuk\\\" and although hunted they are greatly respected. Polar bears can close their nostrils and hold their breath for two minutes under water. They sleep about seven hours a day at a stretch plus naps. Polar bears are fastidious about keeping their coats clean. Bears might feast for 20 minutes then spend as long again cleaning themselves up. They have the same body temperature as humans. They have black skin and tongues. Polar bears are born blind, toothless and with just a thin covering of hair. Attacks by polar bears on humans are rare and only occur when the bear is provoked or undernourished.

Arc Resistant Low Voltage Switchgear This enclosure was designed to be robust enough to contain the high pressure and heat present during an arc flash event. If arcing occurs, the doors of the switchgear remain closed and the vents seal off-protecting the operator from contact with the arc. Flash Gard Motor Control Center This MCC lowers the probability of the creation of a short circuit phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground fault, lowering the possibility of an arc flash event. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"in_qgold10\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"in_qgold100\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8511400818824768\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Home \\u00bb College How Long Does It Take to Get a Doctorate in English? By Tom King The Short Answer While a doctorate in English is helpful in any field where the ability to communicate is essential, a recent survey of individuals who completed doctorates in English found that more than half of respondents took more than 9 years to complete the degree. Slightly fewer than half took from 5 to 9 years and a minuscule 5 percent managed to complete the work in just 3 to 5 years. Unemployment rates among holders of English doctorates are lower than the general unemployment rates. While tenured professorships are a little scarce, many English Ph. D.s find success in professional-level jobs in management, writing and editing, public relations, publishing and even politics, in addition to academia. Why So Long? If you pursue a stand-alone master's degree first and then reapply to a Ph. D. program, you'll have a completed master's in 3 to 7 years depending on how hard you work. Getting the master's degree first may help improve your financial situation if you are teaching. Plan on another 2 to 9 years for the doctorate. Often, but not always, you can count all your master's work toward your doctorate. If you go directly into a doctoral program, you may spend less time getting your degree, but the financial cost without the pay \\\"bump\\\" of getting the master's may actually slow you down in the long run. Few can afford a full-time doctoral program because of tuition costs. Many elect to take coursework in the summer and at night on a pay-as-you-go basis while working at full-time teaching jobs. This accounts for the 51 percent who take more than 9 years to finish. What You Can Do to Reduce the Time It Takes If your family can't help you financially, look for programs that offer graduate teaching-assistant jobs or other types of work-study. To finish a doctorate in 3 to 5 years, live as simply as possible, study hard, and focus on your graduate work. Go easy on the student loans if you can. It may take a few years after graduation to get your career on track.

Home & Garden Outdoor Q: How much does a new asphalt driveway cost? A: Quick Answer The cost of a new asphalt driveway depends on the size of the driveway, but on average costs $3 to $4 per square foot. Nationally, most homeowners spend between $3,447 and $4,919 on a new asphalt driveway, as of 2014. Continue Reading Keep Learning What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway? What are some tips for fixing an asphalt driveway? What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway per square foot? Full Answer Only a local contractor can give you the exact cost of a new asphalt driveway. Prices vary by geographical location and are subject to change year to year, based on the cost of raw materials, government regulations, demand and labor charges. Asphalt cost is based on a \\\"per ton\\\" basis. Added to this is the cost of crew and machinery used, in addition to other miscellaneous costs. The depth of the asphalt and quality of the preparation also factor into the final cost of the driveway. A reputable contractor digs a base of 4 to 6 inches for a new driveway, adds driveway gravel, grades the surface properly, and lays 3 to 4 inches of base asphalt, followed by another 1 to 2 inches of topcoat asphalt. Some unscrupulous contractors try to undercut the competition by quoting lower prices and then skimping on the preparation and using less asphalt, resulting in a driveway that soon cracks and falls apart. A well-constructed and maintained asphalt driveway lasts for 20 years or more.

Before starting any project, it is a good idea to calculate costs to understand the financial impact of the project. This goes double for any home improvements such as asphalting a driveway. If you wait for the contractors to do the estimate, you will just have to take them at their word. Calculating the cost prior to the project will strengthen your price negotiating position. Step 1Measure the area of the driveway to determine how much asphalt you will need for the driveway. It is usually best to add an inch or two of area all the way around to allow for asphalting waste. Step 2Decide how deep the asphalt driveway will be. If you lay the asphalt driveway over an existing driveway, you will need to measure from the top of that surface and add in any filler areas if there are damaged areas in the existing asphalt. However, should you want to completely tear out the existing driveway, you must measure from the ground up. Typically, asphalt driveways are 2 inches deep. Step 3Determine how much a base you will need to install below the asphalt driveway. If you are going to tear out the old driveway, there must be an installation of base material on which the asphalt sits. The base will use slightly less area than the asphalt but will usually be an inch or two deeper. Step 4Choose the type of asphalt you want to use on your driveway. Pure asphalt is more expensive but lasts longer, while recycled asphalt is cheaper but does not wear as well as pure asphalt. If you plan to sell in few years, you may want to opt for the cheaper asphalt, but if you live there any longer, pure asphalt is best. Step 5Call the local materials supply store to determine the price per square foot of asphalt top coating and base. If you are tearing out the existing driveway, you will need to ask for the price per square foot of base stone. Step 6Calculate the cost of asphalting a driveway by multiplying the square foot size of the driveway by the cost of the asphalt and, if necessary, the base stone. Then multiply that number by the depth of the driveway, because the square foot price of asphalt is usually by the inch in depth. Step 7Add in the cost of labor if you are going to pay others to asphalt the driveway. In a do-it-yourself project, you will need to factor in the cost of renting the asphalting equipment. This is the total cost of asphalting a driveway.

A basic asphalt driveway costs about $2 to $6 per square foot, including installation. That provides you with a base and a top coat. The price goes up from there if you add features like a chip seal top coat, which extends the life of the driveway, or a decorative top coat that is stamped or colored. With those features, you could spend $8 or more per square foot. If you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the asphalt. Asphalt Driveway Pros Price - Asphalt is considerably less expensive than concrete. In some cases, it\\u2019s about half the price. Better in cold climates - Asphalt is less likely to crack in cold weather. It performs better than concrete in very harsh or snowy climates. Snow removal is also easier with asphalt. Won\\u2019t show stains - Because asphalt is generally dark in color, in doesn\\u2019t show oil stains. Easier to repair - Cracks and holes can be filled more easily with asphalt driveways. Asphalt driveways can be repaired or re-layered, while concrete generally needs to be replaced. Asphalt Driveway Cons Shorter lifespan - Asphalt doesn\\u2019t last as long. The lifespan is generally about 15 to 20 years - half that of concrete. More maintenance required - Asphalt needs to be resealed every three to five years, particularly if you want it to last. Oily texture - Asphalt has an oily texture that softens in heat or direct sunlight. If the asphalt gets stuck to your shoes and you track it through the house, it can stain your floors. Rough edges - WIth asphalt, it can be difficult to get a straight, clean edge. Concrete Driveway Overview Concrete is another popular material for driveways, particularly in the south. Cement is mixed with a variety of sand and gravel to create this strong, durable material. How Much Does a Concrete Driveway Cost? Basic, construction-grade concrete costs about $5 to $10 per square foot, including installation. Opting for fancier, decorative versions such as stamped or colored concrete will add several dollars per square foot to the price. Very high-end concrete could cost as much as $15 per square foot. Again, if you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the concrete. Removal of an existing driveway usually runs $50 to $60 per hour. Concrete Driveway Pros Long lasting - Concrete has a long life expectancy. Properly maintained, it can last 30 to 40 years. Low maintenance - Concrete driveways don\\u2019t need to be resealed as often, particularly in mild climates. Better in warm climates - Unlike asphalt, concrete will not soften in hot weather. Concrete Driveway Cons Prone to cracking - Due to frost heaves, concrete will eventually crack in cold climates. It is also susceptible to salt damage. Unlike asphalt, damage to a concrete driveway is difficult - if not impossible - to repair. The driveway usually needs to be replaced. Stains easily - Due to the light color, concrete shows almost every type of stain, particularly oil stains. Price - Concrete is significantly more expensive than asphalt.

Compare free price quotes from multiple companies and save time and money instantly! No obligations to hire or purchase ever!Find a Driveway Pro >>How Much Does an Asphalt Driveway Cost? A basic asphalt driveway costs about $2 to $6 per square foot, including installation. That provides you with a base and a top coat. The price goes up from there if you add features like a chip seal top coat, which extends the life of the driveway, or a decorative top coat that is stamped or colored. With those features, you could spend $8 or more per square foot. If you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the asphalt. Asphalt Driveway Pros Price - Asphalt is considerably less expensive than concrete. In some cases, it\\u2019s about half the price. Better in cold climates - Asphalt is less likely to crack in cold weather. It performs better than concrete in very harsh or snowy climates. Snow removal is also easier with asphalt. Won\\u2019t show stains - Because asphalt is generally dark in color, in doesn\\u2019t show oil stains. Easier to repair - Cracks and holes can be filled more easily with asphalt driveways. Asphalt driveways can be repaired or re-layered, while concrete generally needs to be replaced. Asphalt Driveway Cons Shorter lifespan - Asphalt doesn\\u2019t last as long. The lifespan is generally about 15 to 20 years - half that of concrete. More maintenance required - Asphalt needs to be resealed every three to five years, particularly if you want it to last. Oily texture - Asphalt has an oily texture that softens in heat or direct sunlight. If the asphalt gets stuck to your shoes and you track it through the house, it can stain your floors. Rough edges - WIth asphalt, it can be difficult to get a straight, clean edge. Concrete Driveway Overview Concrete is another popular material for driveways, particularly in the south. Cement is mixed with a variety of sand and gravel to create this strong, durable material. How Much Does a Concrete Driveway Cost? Basic, construction-grade concrete costs about $5 to $10 per square foot, including installation. Opting for fancier, decorative versions such as stamped or colored concrete will add several dollars per square foot to the price. Very high-end concrete could cost as much as $15 per square foot. Again, if you\\u2019re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the concrete. Removal of an existing driveway usually runs $50 to $60 per hour. Concrete Driveway Pros Long lasting - Concrete has a long life expectancy. Properly maintained, it can last 30 to 40 years. Low maintenance - Concrete driveways don\\u2019t need to be resealed as often, particularly in mild climates. Better in warm climates - Unlike asphalt, concrete will not soften in hot weather. Concrete Driveway Cons Prone to cracking - Due to frost heaves, concrete will eventually crack in cold climates. It is also susceptible to salt damage. Unlike asphalt, damage to a concrete driveway is difficult - if not impossible - to repair. The driveway usually needs to be replaced. Stains easily - Due to the light color, concrete shows almost every type of stain, particularly oil stains. Price - Concrete is significantly more expensive than asphalt.

Donovan Frequently I get asked the question by homeowners on whether or not a driveway can be asphalt paved in winter. The answer depends on whether or not the ground is frozen. Simply put, if the ground is frozen do not allow the asphalt paving contractor to apply the asphalt. If it is applied when the ground is frozen it will not roll to grade well. The asphalt arrives on the job site extremely hot allowing it to be easily spread and rolled to grade. Find a local paving contractor here. However, if the hot asphalt is poured onto a frozen surface such as the ground, the asphalt will immediately begin to stiffen or freeze up. Check out this Asphalt Driveway Paving Bid Sheet that will answer many of your questions and help you find the right paving contractor for your project. Even if the asphalt driveway is able to be rolled to grade while the ground is frozen it will result in a poor quality driveway that will quickly begin to break down. The reason for this is the aggregate material embedded in the asphalt will not be firmly packed with the asphalt, thus resulting in stones quickly becoming loose. If, the temperature is below freezing, but the ground has not yet frozen it is acceptable to have the Asphalt paving contractor install the asphalt driveway. Unlike a frozen ground, below freezing air temperatures will not dramatically affect the rate of hardening of the asphalt material. Thus the asphalt paving contractor will be able to roll the asphalt to grade and achieve the right level of compression. To conclude, if you live in the northern half of the United States, and it is already December, it is probably wise to hold off any asphalt paving projects until springtime.

Home & Garden Outdoor Q: How much does a new asphalt driveway cost? A: Quick Answer The cost of a new asphalt driveway depends on the size of the driveway, but on average costs $3 to $4 per square foot. Nationally, most homeowners spend between $3,447 and $4,919 on a new asphalt driveway, as of 2014. Continue Reading Keep Learning What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway? What are some tips for fixing an asphalt driveway? What is the average cost of an asphalt driveway per square foot? Full Answer Only a local contractor can give you the exact cost of a new asphalt driveway. Prices vary by geographical location and are subject to change year to year, based on the cost of raw materials, government regulations, demand and labor charges. Asphalt cost is based on a \\\"per ton\\\" basis. Added to this is the cost of crew and machinery used, in addition to other miscellaneous costs. The depth of the asphalt and quality of the preparation also factor into the final cost of the driveway. A reputable contractor digs a base of 4 to 6 inches for a new driveway, adds driveway gravel, grades the surface properly, and lays 3 to 4 inches of base asphalt, followed by another 1 to 2 inches of topcoat asphalt. Some unscrupulous contractors try to undercut the competition by quoting lower prices and then skimping on the preparation and using less asphalt, resulting in a driveway that soon cracks and falls apart. A well-constructed and maintained asphalt driveway lasts for 20 years or more.
