Jan 19, 2014 by NATASHA LONGOThis Is What Happens In Your Stomach When You Consume Packaged Ramen Noodles With a Deadly Preservative Ramen noodles contain Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), which is a byproduct of the petroleum industry and food additive frequently to preserve cheap processed foods. It is one of those chemicals that is neither digestible or beneficial in any way for your body. A gastrointestinal specialist conducted an experiment with a time lapse video inside the stomach, comparing both fresh and preserved ramen noodles. After two hours of digestion, the results were staggering. The first-of-its-kind experiment by Dr. Braden Kuo of Massachusetts General Hospital wanted to find out exactly what happens to food in the stomach and digestive tract after consuming ramen noodles. Thanks to the \\\"smart pill,\\\" a camera the size of a multi-vitamin, Dr. Kuo could do his experiment, showing what happens in the gut of someone who ate a package of instant ramen noodles compared to fresh. Dr. Kuo recorded 32 hours from the pill camera. \\\"What we're seeing here is a stomach contracting back and forth as it's trying to grind up the ramen noodles,\\\" Dr. Kuo says of the beginning of the video. For comparison, the study volunteers also ate fresh, homemade ramen noodles on a different day. The video at 20 minutes, and 2 hours, shows a striking difference. \\\"The most striking thing about our experiment when you looked at a time interval, say in one or two hours, we noticed a processed ramen noodles were less broken down that homemade ramen noodles,\\\" noted Dr. Kuo. This affects nutrient absorption and could theoretically allow preservatives to linger longer periods in the stomach cavity before being transported to the intestines and subsequently eliminated. What Is TBHQ? In processed foods, it's sprayed on the food or on its packaging to prevent discoloration and changes to flavor and odor. Others products, such as cosmetics, perfumes, varnishes and lacquers, contain TBHQ to maintain stability. Small amounts of TBHQ may not kill you (although death has occurred) or even make you feel immediately sick, but it can have a long term effect on your health such as weakening of organs and contributing to the onset of cancers and tumors. The FDA says that TBHQ must not exceed 0.02 percent of its oil and fat content. Death has occurred from the ingestion of as little as 5 grams. This would be a considerably high dose compared to the amounts found in foods, but it gives us a good indication on the toxicity level of this preservative. At higher doses, it has some negative health effects on lab animals, such as producing precursors to stomach tumors and damage to DNA. A number of studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high doses of TBHQ may be carcinogenic, especially for stomach tumors. Ingestion of a single gram (a thirtieth of an ounce) has caused nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, diarrhea, ringing in the ears, delirium, a sense of suffocation, and collapse. Some people have reported having anxiety and night terrors and asthma after ingesting TBHQ. Others have reported having a body rash and swollen lymph nodes. You can find TBHQ in Mc Donald\\u2019s chicken Mcnuggets across the United States, however Mcdonalds European chicken nuggets do not contain the toxic preservative. This is interesting since both the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the FDA have evaluated TBHQ and determined that it is safe to consume at the concentration allowed in foods. The EFSA considers TBHQ to be non-carcinogenic, so why do they not allow it in chicken mcnuggets? Other Food Products Containing TBHQ: Mcdonalds chicken nuggets and french fries CHEEZ-IT Crackers made by Kelloggs Butterfinger chocolate and Resee\\u2019s Peanut butter cups Nestle Crunch Wheat Thins Microwave popcorn Pam cooking spray Aldi products Keebler Club crackers Kellogs eggo frozen waffles and many other kellog products Taco bell beans and some taco shells Teddy Grahams Red Barron frozen pizza Keebler Cookies Tasty Kake Little Debbie Kellog\\u2019s Pop-Tarts Homestyle Peanut butter cookies Some forms of soymilk Different breads cerals and crackers could contain TBHQCrisco oil Some pet foods Many cosmetic products and baby products Some hair dyes lipsticks and eyeshadows Wrigley\\u2019s gum Little Debbies nutty bars and some M&M products KFC beans and fried chicken There are many more processed foods not listed above which contain TBHQ. A conclusion that is now quickly reaching vast numbers is that all processed food in general, has far too many problems to be considered safe. Our regulatory agencies are not responsibly catering to the problems and instead of removing these toxins from the food supply, are claiming that safe levels exist. Since when did safe levels exist of any poison entering the body?

So technically, aren't vitamins toxic? Too much sugar can cause diabetes. Toxic. Too much water causes hyponatremia which can be fatal. Toxic. Awareness and moderation in all things. Richard Cheese \\u2022 2 years ago Congratulations. You get the award for idiot of the day. Massive \\u2022 2 years ago They make the point that the dosage is a factor. Vitamin C has no know toxic level, there is a bowel tolerance. I can't imagine a practical way you could kill yourself. The stupid behaviour required to kill yourself through ingestion of water is pretty transparent. The difference is twofold. The real concern is whether the trace amounts of these chemical are harmful. General toxicity may nod in that direction, but they are different issues. Small amounts of vitamin C are great for you, some additives have been found not to be The second issue is what the additive is there for. If a compound is unusual in the human food chain, toxic in some amount, and has no useful purpose post ingestion, why is it in my diet? It may well be useful in some regard, but I would wonder why I am eating it. Vitamin C is not made in the body, is essential to life, has some processing advantages, and is a good thing to eat. Is the difference really so incomprehensible? Another thing about vitamins is they don't change the formula every few years to avoid regulatory oversight. Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago Dude, 5 grams is a (figurative) TON when considering toxicity. Think about medications folks take. Usually in the 0.250 - 0.400 g for anitbiotics (sometimes 1g for single dose treatments) or others: 0.080g for the strongest dose of Oxy Contin, 0.010 g for the strongest dose of Ambien, 0.002 g for the strongest dose of Xanax. 5 g is orders of magnitude greater. And I'm assuming that your 5 g statistic is correct, which after this alarmist piece, I am skeptical. Instant Ramen is not going to kill you. Jesus, people are just looking to find things to be alarmed about and just making stuff up. Read the safety section from the wiki page. This is so a non-story: http://en.wikipedia.org/wik... Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago Yes, and there are also wikipedia pages on the safety levels of lead, mercury, cadmium and many other heavy metals, yet all of them may accumulate in the body in the long-term and none are theoretically safe at any level. Yet synergeistic toxicity in the body is very real and has been correlated to infant mortality through multi-doses in children http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.... Alan D Smith \\u2022 3 years ago Wikipedia is a total pack of lies. I've tried to correct false information there many times. It always reverted back to the lie in a day or so.

Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago Disqus did us all a disserve when it took away the down vote button. T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago These days people are getting cancer at an alarming rate. Besides that obesity, IDDM, hyperlipidemia, HTN and so many illness are on the rise is the US. Just looking at baby-boomers alone research shows they are aging faster and are more ill than the generation before. This can not be a coincidence. I believe it's the inclusion of plastics and preservatives into our food culture. All the items are pointing the source, but it takes time to prove. Also, remember in the 50s/60 when data came forth that cigarettes were causing lung cancer (and later other cancers & illness) there were many criticizing its validity, but it ended up being true. Took a significant amount of years to prove the truth. I say it is time we take heed as consumers. We can not wait on an \\\"official publically approved\\\" proof. We have little pieces of evidence here and there that should suffice. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Well come on. We can pretty much all do the math here. People are working longer, have less quality time spent with loved ones and feeling good, don't meditate, don't walk anywhere ever, eat out of paper bags tossed through windows. All that can't possibly lead us to long life and healthy bodies. James Childress \\u2022 3 years ago That ramen in the gut doesn't look like the consumer actually chewed it. Who swallows ramen whole without chewing it up? Failure to chew will slow down the digestion process. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago EXACTLY what I said! Everyone knows digestion begins in the mouth. This must have been a toothless and very hunger booger to have slurped it down unchewed like that. John \\u2022 3 years ago There was a point in my life where all I ate were ramon noodles - morning, noon and night. I switched to Jack N the Box - had a stroke at 26 and now I cook everything from home. Draw your own conclusions. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago I would think the cumulative effect of a lifelong bad diet did you in at only 26, not switching back to Jack in the Box. Yes, let's draw our own conclusions. Danny Bowen \\u2022 4 years ago Since when did safe levels exist of any poison? So are you saying that since water at certain amounts is \\\"toxic\\\" it is a poison, and therefor at any amounts should not be ingested? Did you THINK before you wrote any of this? Katherine Morgan \\u2022 4 years ago And did YOU think before posting such an absurd response... Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago He did and has an excellent point, Katherine. Almost everything will kill you in extreme excess. Not only does the author not mention how much is in a package of Ramen, but he also fails to understand that 5 g is not a little amount in this context. There are tons of things that are perfectly safe at low doses - and this is one of them. Stop looking for boogiemen in everything. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago No amount of any toxin is safe. Anything natural taken in excess can be toxic, however, anything artificial and poisonous is not safe in any amount. It is a sad reality that people justify foods based on their cost or taste, regardless of their toxicity. And when information is presented even in a video that demonstrates that the same preserved food (vs fresh) is not being broken down by the body, people turn a blind eye and attempt to justify why that is so. They then dismiss the information as alarmist rather than taking a step back thinking \\\"hey maybe this chemical shouldn't be in our food supply?\\\" or \\\"why are we eating anything processed that relies on chemical harmful preservatives at all?\\\" Instead, people argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods. It's what we refer to as the sheeple paying tribute and defending those that poison them. Michael Cooney \\u2022 4 years ago I'm sorry, but your first statement is patently false. Our bodies deal with and process \\\"toxins\\\" all the time - take for instance apple seeds, which contain a compound which our bodies break down into cyanide. Cyanide can cause asphyxiation in some doses; however, our bodies are capable of metabolizing small doses of cyanide such that eating an apple core - or even 10 apple cores - don't harm us. Toxicity absolutely depends on dosage; there is no chemical so potent that a single molecule will kill us and there is no chemical so inert that a massive quantity will not kill us. Even water kills at sufficiently high doses by creating an extreme imbalance in your electrolytes. So yes, it is completely relevant to ask how much is in a container of ramen. If what you state were true, there would be no food that would pass such a strict standard. Second issue: there are many things we eat which do not digest. Fiber is one of them. Every time you eat a fruit, there is a large part of that which is indigestible. Any time you eat anything, there is a lot that is not digestible. To be blunt, this is why we defecate. I would agree that it's likely better to eat food that we use more of, assuming we still have a certain level of fiber in our diet. Third, chemicals don't scare me, and I wish they wouldn't scare you so much. Everything you eat contains chemicals. You don't even know what half of them are - scientists don't even know what some of them are. There is no complete catalog of every chemical that is in an apple or a stalk of celery or a haunch of organic beef. We eat these chemicals all the time without a thought, and we misattribute this to it being \\\"natural\\\". I say misattribute, because you are cherry-picking (perhaps literally!). You are ignoring all the natural organisms out there which you don't eat because they'd kill you. The potato plant, other than the root, is poisonous, for example. We've had generations upon generations of trial and error to determine generally what won't kill us in the next 24 hours, but we have almost no research on what might kill us after a lifetime of exposure. Who knows, maybe eating those apple seeds every day will produce early onset dimensia, but no one has thought to even study it. We give a pass to \\\"natural\\\" chemical, yet we jump upon man-made chemicals. That's not dispassionate, scientific thinking. I can assure you; I do not have Stockholm syndrome. I eat organically, when I can, because I do think the abundance of antibiotics and hormones we use are likely not good for the environment. But those beliefs are due to scientific study, not hunches. I don't hold a prejudicial attitude against anything man has made. We've made some pretty darn good things and some pretty crappy, harmful things. How could I immediately praise or write them off without doing any dispassionate scientific study? Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Great comment!T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago I know this is month ago. However, I am wondering if you can answer a general question. Do you think preservatives in our foods are causing inflammation, cancers and other harmful outcomes in the modern human body? Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago\\\"however, anything artificial and poisonous is not safe in any amount. \\\"The 'artificial' bit is utter and complete nonsense!And, a substance is considered 'poisonous', when: the dose is within a certain range that causes harm or death; and/or by a particular route of administration (ROA) that exacerbates harm or hastens death by acting via a different mechanism. If no harm is caused by a particular dose or ROA, then the use of the word 'poisonous' is not justified. Colloquially, we call substances (not required in our diet) that cause harm at very low doses, 'poisons' or 'poisonous'. I get that, hence the confusion for some. Don't be constrained by a definition, especially not a colloquial one. Sodium cyanide (Na CN) is generally considered poisonous, because it causes harm at doses as low as say, 5 to 10 mg (I'm just guessing; don't quote me on this), and we do not require it in our diet; but if we were to ingest say 5 nanograms of Na CN, there would be no harm done and nothing to call 'poisonous'. One final thought. Antioxidants (in relation to food) are considered healthful. You will never guess why TBHQ is added as a preservative? It's an antioxidant. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago What are you talking about? Look at soap. It's made with lye which is caustic but mixed properly, it's the bubbly wonderful stuff we use every day in one way or another. Yes...what Michael Cooney said. James Doe \\u2022 4 years ago Just drink vodka and you'll be fine!Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Amen. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago You seem constrained by your own definition of the word 'poison'. All substances can be considered a 'poison'; the dose, and the route of administration, differentiate poisons from benign substances.brothersun \\u2022 3 years ago Maybe the stomach is contracting to try to grind up the pill-cam!

Besides making them rubbery it also raises their melting point which increases shelf life but also makes it hard to digest them and harder still ...to get any actual food nutrients from them. A person might as well eat a football. To put this in perspective butyl groups are used in everything from rubber tires to footballs. lol What's worse is their parent base for the chemical is hydroquinone. Here's a warning from the MSDS. Toxicity to Animals: Acute oral toxicity (LD50): 320 mg/kg [Rat.]. Acute dermal toxicity (LD50): 5970 mg/kg [Mammal]. Chronic Effects on Humans: The substance is toxic to lungs, the nervous system, mucous membranes. Karen Sherry Brackett \\u2022 4 years ago To put the MSDS for hydroquinone into perspective.... basically a 160 pound person would need to eat only ounces of 4-butylhydroquinone to reach acute toxicity at which point damage to their lungs and nervous system will start to be exhibited in a pronounced way. So, if barely half a pound taken all at once will produce acute toxicity damage then every exposure less than that will be causing damage as well only to a degree not physically noticeable as a symptom but with the potential to accumulate to the same level of symptom if not worse degrees of damage. So, while the content per package is very small because it is in use in so many products the over all exposure to this chemical is likely to be high and consequently a severe health hazard. This chemical really needs to be banned from all food products in my opinion. Also, keep in that this determination is only based on the parent molecule for hydroquinone and does not even take into account the health effects of the additional four butyl groups to the human body. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago First, 4-butylhydroquinone is NOT the same as t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), so do not get them confused. Second, the potential to accumulate in the system is not possible as it is not stored but excreted, just like most things. You would rupture your digestive system long before you could get to a toxic level before you excreted it. You would have to ingest 5 kilograms of foods to have ingested 1 gram of TBHQ. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 3 years ago Ok, we're clearly coming from different angles Nicholas. We don't share your perspective, but thanks for your feedback. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 4 years ago Again, why argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods. That's like ordering a pizza and spreading a little bit of drano plumbing powder because it tastes good, but lets not put too much because it's toxic at higher levels. It's a very illogical argument. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago There are toxins in everything. Just breathing introduces toxins into the body. Organically grown foods have toxins, but you do not recommend that we not eat these foods. The normal human body can and does handle these toxins (both natural and man made) with little or no problem. The TBHQ is used as a food preservative in many foods including butter. Without it the foods would not have the ability to be stored, and without that ability these foods would not be available to the majority of people. Not everyone has a cow. Yes freshly made noodles are easier to digest and may be healthier, they are also MUCH more expensive per serving and take time that is not always available for food preparation. T. Vernay \\u2022 3 years ago I think it is about knowledge. If you choose to eat food knowing that it contains harmful items that were not meant to be digested by the body it is your choice. However, it is important that the public has knowledge to make such a choice also. Massive \\u2022 2 years ago Call BS on that. Making your own noodles is far cheaper. Making your own bread pays for the breadmaker in s a few weeks. and noodle makers that used to cost hundreds are pretty cheap also. People don't want to take the time, which is trivial once the routine is down, but they spend the time making the money and shopping. The problem is that the people who get into this stuff want to make flax kumquat bread, etc... And it takes a while to perfect a recipe so they loose interest. There isn't that much interest in using the machines to make a cheap normal bread because that isn't the magic most people are looking for. But is it healthier, fast, and cheaper? Sure. Prevent Disease.com \\u2022 3 years ago Of course the human body will handle toxins but the point is, you have hundreds of other choices aside from ramen noodles which do not have this preservative. Any toxins you may consider organically grown foods to contain are grown from the Earth and those can be handled effectively by bodily absorption, distribution, and metabolism whereas many of these type of toxins accumulate in the body and are not as easily metabolized or assimilated. THBQ is not in organic butter. You can make all the excuses in the world to consume preservatives, but in the end that's all they are, excuses because you always have a choice to eat healthier and consume fresh wholesome foods than those which are processed. You always have a choice. Nicholas Humerickhouse \\u2022 3 years ago Yes, the choice is there. Organic butter does not have THBQ. It also does not have a shelf life that makes it marketable except locally. And it does have a higher cost to the consumer. And while many toxins accumulate in the body and are dangerous, THBQ is not one of them. There are many reasons to not consume almost all of the foods that contain THBQ, but the toxicity is a very minor one. Rather you should limit or refrain consumption because of the high fat content of the chicken nuggets and butter, or the EXTREME sodium levels in the ramen flavour packet. Nixon Virtual Strategies \\u2022 3 years ago Yes but organic also costs a fortune AND I don't even trust that the little sticker on a supposed organic tomato means anything so I can't justify the cost. How many times has it been revealed that lower level products have been sold masquerading as a more expensive version or brand? It's a shame, though, really that even eating well is a luxury for some. I would have to quadruple my current food budget just to do whatever I could to buy better. I love, love, love fresh veggies and salads, fruits and the whole bit but I have more to do with my money than buy food. Bill De Lozier \\u2022 4 years agoyes , i agree. romans used lead for plumbing and decided wine tastes better in lead vessels. small doses over time are as debilitating as one large dose. the wealthy in ancient Rome became poisened over time and also sterile. their children died young as well. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Everything is toxic or poisonous -- or it is not -- it all depends on the dose and route of administration (ROA). \\\"why argue dose and make excuses to justify the toxins in our foods\\\"Because at certain doses (and ROAs) these substances ARE NOT TOXINS. Drano is for drains, it was never meant for consumption, furthermore Drano is a mixture of several substances listed below for the crystal formulation:1. sodium hydroxide (aka lye or caustic soda),2. sodium nitrate,3. sodium chloride,4. aluminum (as metal flakes)Number 1 is used to make German pretzels, it's also used to remove a nasty tasting compound from unripe olives (green olives). It's also used to make soap, especially homemade soap. I wonder if green olives are good on pizza? Number 2 is used to cure country hams. A bit of country ham on a pizza might be delicious. I'll keep my eye out for the next Tombstone limited-time speciality pizza with country ham. Yum. Number 3 is found extensively in pizza. It's table salt. Number 4 is used to make aluminum-foil, cookware (pots, pans, cookie sheets, 1/2 and full-sized restaurant style sheet pans, etc.) I use a 1/2 sheet pan lined with aluminum foil to bake my Tombstone pizzas on. Of those substances, sodium hydroxide is the most poisonous, no, actually it's corrosive. Trace amounts in your soap may dry out your skin faster. Trace amounts in pretzels or green olives are not an issue because at those levels (doses) they cause no harm whatsoever. Obviously, a large dose will dissolve your skin or tissue of your esophagus. That's why it's used to clear drains. It breaks down hair, and dead skin. When you make soap, you use sodium hydroxide to convert fat into soap (a fatty acid sodium salt) and glycerine, which can now dissolve in water. It does the same thing to grease in your drain. One can use aluminum cookware with few issues, but if you were to swallow many aluminum metal flakes, they might tear up your digestive tract, or pass through without issue, or cause aluminum poisoning, but it depend on how much you swallowed. Sodium nitrate is probably the most poisonous but only at very high doses. What's left in a country ham causes no harm. It would appear much of Drano is already on, or in, or involved with your pizza. But only a total f*cking idiot would put Drano on his pizza. That would be much too high a dose of FOUR different substances, that when combined with water, create heat and react chemically to unclog drains. I would not want that happening in my stomach, but to continue your Drano analogy, lets say I measure out 1 micro gram of a Drano crystal and swallowed it. Would I die, get sick, or be harmed? Nope. The dose it too low. If this analogy is still insufficient to allow people to comprehend what I originally wrote above, and repeated below...\\\"Everything is toxic or poisonous -- or it is not -- it all depends on the dose and route of administration (ROA). \\\"...then I am at a loss for a better way to explain it. Perhaps my analogue actually sucks; but I must also entertain the slight possibility, that this may be incomprehensible to a few select people. Brian Diaz \\u2022 2 years ago Hydroquinone is not the same substance as TBHQ. But let's go with your example anyways. 160 lbs / 2.2 kg/lbs = 72.7 kg. 5970 mg/kg x 72.7 kg = 434,019 mg 434,019 mg / 1000 mg/g = 434 g434 g = 15. 3 oz (I Googled it) Your mammals would have to eat just under a pound of hydroquinone before half of them would die. That seems pretty darned safe to me. Your calculation was a bit off but you were in the ballpark. It's odd you said \\\"'barely' half a pound taken at once\\\" Is not a half of a pound a lot of hydroquinone? This is not the amount of food you would have to eat, but the amount of pure hydroquinone you would have to eat. Now ask how much food you would need to eat as a test mammal to consume 15.3 oz of pure hydroquinone? IDK, cause it's not the substance in question, but I'll bet it is lots. Kel \\u2022 2 years ago The TBHQ won't kill you as quick as 1200 mg's of the SALT per serving...

The series follows the life of Melinda Gordon ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ), who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. While trying to live as normal a life as possible\\u2014she is married and owns an antique store\\u2014Melinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the Light, or the spirit world. Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and disbelieve her ability. In addition, the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing in the beginning and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirit's needs and help them. [1]Ghost Whisperer ' s fifth and final season aired in the United States (U. S.) on Fridays at 8:00 pm ET on CBS, a terrestrial television network, followed by the sixth season of Medium, where it received an average of 7.78 million viewers per episode, becoming the least watched season of the series. [2] It receives around 200,000 viewers per episode in New Zealand, and is constantly rated in the top 5 for TV2 every Monday. Contents1 Plot2 Development3 Syndication4 Cancellation5 Cast6 Episodes7 References Plot [ edit]In the fifth season, five years have elapsed since the events of the previous season, and we are introduced to Jim and Melinda's son, Aiden Lucas. We learn that he can see the \\\"Shinies and the Shadows\\\", two opposing groups of ghosts that Melinda is unable to see. The Shadows are revealed to be the negative part of spirits that get left behind when they cross over, and their motives involve acquiring the Book of Changes. Melinda, Ned, and Eli, with the frequent help of Delia, work to keep the book safe from the Shadows. Throughout the season, Melinda struggles to keep Aiden safe and help him with his gift. He has frequent run-ins with the Shinies, who are presumed to be the kind group of spirits and are attracted to shiny objects. The Shadows show tremendous power throughout the season, forcing President Bedford, the president of Rockland University to blow up Delia's real estate office. At the end of the series, Melinda and Jim try to protect Aiden by convincing him that ghosts don't exist (at the advice of Carl the Watcher, later revealed to be under the influence of the Shadows). The Shadows gradually begin to take possession of Melinda's body. Aiden is told by Carl that he must go to Melinda's store. Jim, Ned, Eli and Delia follow with him. Melinda is inside, being engulfed by the Shadows. Aiden, who has forged a friendship with one of the Shinies (previously revealed to be the ghosts of children), enlists their help. In the town square, dozens of Shinies gather, and emit a bright light. The Shinies and their light become visible to passersby in the square. Inside the store, the Shadows are trying to battle the light and fully possess Melinda, but fail on both accounts. Melinda drops to the ground and the group run in. Later that night, Aiden is in his room and Melinda and Jim enter. Melinda tells him that they should both be proud of their gift and that he was her hero that night. Aiden replies that Melinda is a hero every day, and the series closes with a shot of Melinda smiling and tearing up. Development [ edit]Ghost Whisperer is based on the work of \\\"Spirit Communicator\\\" James Van Praagh, [3] who is co- executive producer [4] and regularly updates a blog about the show through Living TV. [5] The stories are also said to be based in part on the work of \\\"Spirit Communicator\\\" Mary Ann Winkowski. [6] Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere. [7]The show was produced by Sander/Moses Productions in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television in season one and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons) and CBS Paramount Network Television in seasons two and three). The show was filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles. [8] One area on the lot is Courthouse Square from the Back to the Future trilogy, though it has been drastically modified to depict Grandview. For example, the clock tower in Back to the Future has been completely covered up. Cast and crew members believe that the set gets visits from real spirits. [9]Sound effects were completed at Smart Post Sound. [10] Visual effects for the pilot and some season one episodes were completed at Flash Film Works. [11] Visual effects for nearly the entire series were created at Eden FX. [12]Creator John Gray grew up in Brooklyn, New York, which is not far from Grandview-On-Hudson, west of the Hudson River. Piermont is often referenced in episodes as the neighboring town, which is accurate to real life as Grandview-On-Hudson is actually located just north of Piermont. Professor Rick Payne worked in the fictional \\\"Rockland University\\\", and perhaps not coincidentally, the actual Grandview, New York is a village located in Rockland County, New York. Syndication [ edit]On May 5, 2008 it was announced that the first three seasons of Ghost Whisperer were purchased for $169.8 million ($700,000 per episode, per network) for syndication by Sy Fy, ION Television, and WE TV. Episodes began airing in Summer 2009 on ION, and in Fall 2009 on Sy Fy and WE. [13] The first four seasons began airing in syndication on CBC Television in Canada on August 31, 2009. [14]Cancellation [ edit]On May 18, 2010, citing rising costs and a decline in viewership, CBS announced that Ghost Whisperer would not be renewed for another season. [15] On May 18, 2010, CBS cancelled the show after five seasons. [16] ABC expressed interest in picking up Ghost Whisperer for Fall 2010. [17] [18] It was revealed on May 19, that writers of the show were informed to not look for other jobs yet, and the producers were very optimistic that there was a good chance of Ghost Whisperer being renewed by ABC. [19] On May 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello reported that ABC had passed on renewing Ghost Whisperer for its sixth season. [20]Zap2it declared Ghost Whisperer is the second \\\"most missed axed show\\\" after a poll determined 17.1 percent of voters would miss it. [21] In October 2010, Jennifer Love Hewitt thanked the fans of the show for their support in a goodbye video (filmed in June, 2010), saying \\\"Your love and support has meant everything to the cast and crew of Ghost Whisperer and we will all miss you guys very, very much. Go get our DVDs, think about us, miss us and know how much we all will miss you. Much love.\\\" She was visibly emotional during the video and simply waved to the camera at the end of the video as she was unable to finish speaking.

Carl tells Mel that because Aiden can see the shadows, they will target him because that weakens them, and that if she tells him ghosts aren't real, he may stop seeing them, which would be the best thing for him. Jim is all for the idea, but Melinda doesn't want to deny his gift. Guest star: Randolph Mantooth.107 22 \\\" The Children's Parade \\\" John Gray John Gray May 21, 2010 6.83 [46]Melinda and Jim told Aiden ghosts aren't real, and neither are the shadows and shinies, but he didn't stop seeing them. Melinda can no longer tell the dead from the living. Eli has trouble talking because of a toothache, but when Carl asks him why Melinda is ignoring him, Eli manages to communicate that he told her Aiden shouldn't see ghosts, and he reveals that he must have been possessed by the shadows when he said that, because he would never normally say such a thing, since it is the worst time for Aiden not to use his gift. At the hospital, the ghost of a thirteen-year-old boy is leading the child ghosts of polio victims on marches to show that they're not afraid of the shadows. Melinda gets completely taken over by the shadows, and when Carl sees Aiden talking to someone he can't see, Aiden reveals that it's a shiny- or the crossed over ghost of a child. After the Book of Changes tells Carl and Eli how to stop the shadows, Aiden must convince the shinies to help. Mel and Aiden cross over the Polio Victims and the boy, and Mel and Jim tell Aiden they were wrong to try to get him to deny his gift.

Killer whale Takara gave birth to her calf at the park in San Antonio, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon. Vets have not yet determined the gender of the calf, but said both mother and baby are in good shape and being monitored closely. Sea World Entertainment Inc popularised killer whale shows in the 1960s but faced growing opposition in recent years. Read More April the giraffe is FINALLY giving birth after months of the world watching and waiting for her calf to arrive The baby's tail emerged first (Image: REUTERS)Attendance at the theme parks has been falling amid negative publicity and criticism from animal rights activists upset by the treatment of captive marine mammals. Takara was already pregnant when the company announced last year that it was suspending its captive breeding programme. Takara swam around the tank as she gave birth (Image: REUTERS)It also vowed to phase out killer whale shows at its three parks in Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California and San Antonio. \\\"This is the last one, and that makes this a particularly big deal,\\\" Sea World Chief Zoological Officer Chris Dold said. \\\"It is a bit bitter sweet. We love these killer whales. \\\"The calf is finally born (Image: REUTERS)The calf was born after an 18-month pregnancy and is estimated to weigh between 300 and 350 pounds and measure between 6 and 7 feet, Sea World said. It was 25-year-old Takara's fifth birth.

Pressure on Sea World mounted after the release of the 2013 documentary \\\"Blackfish,\\\" which depicted the captivity and public exhibition of killer whales as inherently cruel. Vets do not yet know the calf's gender (Image: REUTERS)Animal rights group People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said Sea World should move Takara and her calf from their tank to an \\\"ocean sanctuary,\\\" an area of sea enclosed by nets. \\\"There are a lot of people willing to help. There are companies that have stepped forward and offered major donations,\\\" said PETA's corporate affairs specialist, Stephanie Shaw. \\\"These types of seaside sanctuaries are very doable. \\\"Daily Mirror Follow @Daily Mirror Enter email More On Sea World Whales Giving birth \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

There have been various slide-to-unlock methods and OEMs have always put their own spin on things. As it turns out, there are also a lot of lock screen apps in the Play Store that can do even more. They\\u2019re not as popular as they used to be. However, many people still enjoy the allure of a new lock screen. These days, we usually recommend people just use a finger print scanner to bypass the lock screen altogether. It\\u2019s okay if you don\\u2019t want to do that, though. Here are the best lock screen apps for Android!Here are some more excellent customization apps!15 best Android launcher apps of 201710 best Android themes Ac Display Price: Free / $1-$80DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAc Display is one of the most popular lock screen apps. It emulates the always-on lock screens of devices like the Moto X, Galaxy S8, and others. Users can play with notifications without unlocking their display. It also features some customizations. For instance, you can set it to work only during certain hours to save battery life. More and more devices are coming stock with something similar. Thus, we'd only recommend Ac Display to those with older devices that don't already have this feature. Its last update was in 2015. We're not sure if the developer is doing much with it anymore. At the very least, it's free to download and play with. Alarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAlarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock is an older app. However, its features are still very relevant today. It focuses more on security than anything else. Instead of being ridiculously secure, the app is ridiculously annoying. Someone putting in the wrong passcode will make your phone sound off very loud alarms. It'll also vibrate, blink the screen, and cause a general ruckus. In other words, you will know if someone is getting into your phone. It's one of the few free lock screen apps. Just don't mess up your passcode. Seriously. CM Locker Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMost of Cheetah Mobile's apps are trash. This one isn't so bad. It's a lock screen app and applock hybrid. It features the usual array of security precautions along with the ability to lock apps as needed. That way even if hackers get through the lock screen, they still can't easily get into your apps. The app also features HD wallpapers, notification support, a news feed, and intruder selfies. There are some advertisements. They may or may not bother you depending on your tolerance for such things. It is otherwise free with no in-app purchases. Dash Clock Widget Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYDash Clock Widget isn't technically a lock screen app. It's actually a lock screen widget. However, it still works for a list like this. It delivers the basic stats like time, weather, and some notifications. There are extensions available that increase the number of things you can do. It's actually more effective than most lock screen apps. However, it's only available on devices running Android 4.2-4.4. The number of people with devices running that gets smaller every year. It's still perfectly usable as a home screen widget, though!Echo Notification Lock Screen Price: Free / Up to $4.49DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYEcho Notification is one of those lock screen apps that focuses on notifications. It'll pop them up on your lock screen as you receive them. It's not too different from what we have now in the stock lock screens. However, it's still a fresh take on the idea. The app itself is minimal and easy to use. You can also group notifications into categories like social, work, etc. It also has additional customization features. It's free to try and you can unlock the pro version as an in-app purchase. Here are some more related and recommended app lists!10 best security apps for Android that aren\\u2019t antivirus apps10 best icon packs for Android (by developer)GO Locker Price: Free / $14.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYGO Locker is among the most popular lock screen apps. It has more than 50 million downloads with a decent Play Store rating. Both the free and paid versions come with the basic features. You can set a lock screen pattern and things like that. The free version comes with some themes. You have the option to buy more. Those that go with the $14.99 pro version will have access to every theme in perpetuity. It's not the most unique lockscreen replacement app. It's really good for theming, though. Hi Locker Price: Free / $1.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYHi Locker is a fairly typical lock screen replacement app. It'll show you the basics such as weather, notifications, calendar events, etc. You can also have it greet you with funny quips and greetings. It even has fingerprint support on devices with fingerprint readers. You can also have it auto-set wallpapers from Flickr. There are some customization options as well. For instance, you can have it hide notifications from certain apps so people can't see it. It's not even close to the most complicated lock screen apps, but it's a great replacement for those who don't need a ton of features. Lok Lok Price: Free with in-app purchases DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYLok Lok is different from most lock screen apps. It's almost kind of a mash-up of a lock screen and Snapchat. Turning on the device will open your camera. You can take a picture, draw on that picture, and then send it to your friends or loved ones. They'll see the image when they unlock their phone next and can respond accordingly. It's not great for sending risque pictures, but it's excellent for reminding someone to grab milk on their way home from work. The app is free to use. There are in-app purchases for things like sticker packs. Next Lock Screen Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYNext Lock Screen is Microsoft's foray into the lock screen apps space. It bills itself as a lock screen for professionals. It features the usual fair like notifications, custom unlock methods, calendar appointments, and weather. You can also do things like call contacts, launch apps, access tools (flashlight, camera), and even change the wallpaper. It's essentially a whole home screen on your lock screen. It's not the most secure lock screen out there. However, it's really good for people who have lots of stuff to do. Picturesque Lock Screen Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMicrosoft actually released two lock screen apps. This one is called Picturesque. This one boasts an ever-revolving lock screen wallpaper. It grabs backgrounds from Bing similar to Windows 10 lock screens. There are some other features as well. They include a search bar, various tools like camera and flashlight, and it's compatible with Bing Rewards. Many of its features cater specifically to Indian audiences. However, those not in India can just turn those features off. Only five more apps to go! We have even more fun app lists linked up here!15 best Android Widgets for your home screen!15 best Android apps of 2018!Screen Lock Guardian Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYScreen Lock Guardian focuses more on security than most lock screen apps. It works with you setting a code. Those that break the code will have their picture taken. You can review the photos later in a gallery. It'll also log every unsuccessful attempt so you can see what time it happened. The app also shows you the weather, has a quick launch bar with up to five apps, and more. It isn't the most customizable lock screen. It will definitely show you who's been trying to peep at your info. Smart Lock Screen apps Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYSmart Lock Screen is the name of a developer on Google Play. As you may have guessed, the developer makes lock screen apps. They're actually fairly simple. They consist of a PIN lock with a variety of themes behind them. The animations are nice, but otherwise it's just a simple lock screen.

Do you know anyone who has a well-defined sense of what their values and goals are in life and are highly committed to making them happen? If so, you that person has reached identity achievement. Learn more about identity achievement from this lesson and test your knowledge with a quiz. James Marcia and Identity James Marcia is a Canadian developmental psychologist who is known for his theory of identity development. Following up on Erik Erikson's concepts of identity crisis and identity confusion, Marcia believes that there are 4 processes that adolescents can go through as they develop their identity. Marcia called these processes identity statuses. An adolescent's identity status depends on two conditions: If the adolescent is actively searching for, or exploring, their identity, and if the adolescent is dedicated to, or made a commitment to, any personal values or beliefs. Marcia's four identity statuses are: Identity Diffusion: Adolescents have not yet attempted to find their identity, nor do they have a clear picture of what their identity may be. They have not set any goals for themselves. Identity diffusion is characterized by low commitment and low exploration. Identity Foreclosure: Adolescents have blindly accepted and committed to values and beliefs taught to them by their family, community, or significant others without exploring alternatives. They do not question the values that were taught to them. Identity foreclosure is characterized by high commitment and low exploration. Identity Moratorium: Adolescents are actively experiencing a crisis which has led them to explore their identity and values. However, they have not yet committed to any values or beliefs and are instead experimenting. Identity moratorium is characterized by low commitment and high exploration. Identity Achievement: After a process of active exploration, adolescents have made a strong commitment to a highly developed set of beliefs and values. Identity achievement is characterized by high commitment and high exploration. These four statuses are not sequential. For example, an adolescent may begin at the identity diffusion status and jump right into identity achievement. Though all adolescents will eventually experience at least one of the four identity statuses, they do not have to go through all four statuses. So what does identity achievement in adolescence look like? Example of Identity Achievement Adolescents at the identity achievement stage have actively explored and examined different values and beliefs and have finally chosen those that are most important to them. They are able to sort out who they want to be and what their life's purpose is. They realize what their priorities are. These adolescents are also confident and positive that they chose the right values and beliefs. Let's take Sally, for example. Sally's parents and grandparents are both medical doctors, and as college students they all went to the same medical school. Ever since she can remember, Sally's parents have always told her that she was going to be a surgeon. Although Sally thought the world of her parents, she did not think that she wanted to spend all of her time caring for sick people. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.

There have been various slide-to-unlock methods and OEMs have always put their own spin on things. As it turns out, there are also a lot of lock screen apps in the Play Store that can do even more. They\\u2019re not as popular as they used to be. However, many people still enjoy the allure of a new lock screen. These days, we usually recommend people just use a finger print scanner to bypass the lock screen altogether. It\\u2019s okay if you don\\u2019t want to do that, though. Here are the best lock screen apps for Android!Here are some more excellent customization apps!15 best Android launcher apps of 201710 best Android themes Ac Display Price: Free / $1-$80DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAc Display is one of the most popular lock screen apps. It emulates the always-on lock screens of devices like the Moto X, Galaxy S8, and others. Users can play with notifications without unlocking their display. It also features some customizations. For instance, you can set it to work only during certain hours to save battery life. More and more devices are coming stock with something similar. Thus, we'd only recommend Ac Display to those with older devices that don't already have this feature. Its last update was in 2015. We're not sure if the developer is doing much with it anymore. At the very least, it's free to download and play with. Alarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYAlarm Anti-Theft Screen Lock is an older app. However, its features are still very relevant today. It focuses more on security than anything else. Instead of being ridiculously secure, the app is ridiculously annoying. Someone putting in the wrong passcode will make your phone sound off very loud alarms. It'll also vibrate, blink the screen, and cause a general ruckus. In other words, you will know if someone is getting into your phone. It's one of the few free lock screen apps. Just don't mess up your passcode. Seriously. CM Locker Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMost of Cheetah Mobile's apps are trash. This one isn't so bad. It's a lock screen app and applock hybrid. It features the usual array of security precautions along with the ability to lock apps as needed. That way even if hackers get through the lock screen, they still can't easily get into your apps. The app also features HD wallpapers, notification support, a news feed, and intruder selfies. There are some advertisements. They may or may not bother you depending on your tolerance for such things. It is otherwise free with no in-app purchases. Dash Clock Widget Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYDash Clock Widget isn't technically a lock screen app. It's actually a lock screen widget. However, it still works for a list like this. It delivers the basic stats like time, weather, and some notifications. There are extensions available that increase the number of things you can do. It's actually more effective than most lock screen apps. However, it's only available on devices running Android 4.2-4.4. The number of people with devices running that gets smaller every year. It's still perfectly usable as a home screen widget, though!Echo Notification Lock Screen Price: Free / Up to $4.49DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYEcho Notification is one of those lock screen apps that focuses on notifications. It'll pop them up on your lock screen as you receive them. It's not too different from what we have now in the stock lock screens. However, it's still a fresh take on the idea. The app itself is minimal and easy to use. You can also group notifications into categories like social, work, etc. It also has additional customization features. It's free to try and you can unlock the pro version as an in-app purchase. Here are some more related and recommended app lists!10 best security apps for Android that aren\\u2019t antivirus apps10 best icon packs for Android (by developer)GO Locker Price: Free / $14.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYGO Locker is among the most popular lock screen apps.

It's not the most unique lockscreen replacement app. It's really good for theming, though. Hi Locker Price: Free / $1.99DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYHi Locker is a fairly typical lock screen replacement app. It'll show you the basics such as weather, notifications, calendar events, etc. You can also have it greet you with funny quips and greetings. It even has fingerprint support on devices with fingerprint readers. You can also have it auto-set wallpapers from Flickr. There are some customization options as well. For instance, you can have it hide notifications from certain apps so people can't see it. It's not even close to the most complicated lock screen apps, but it's a great replacement for those who don't need a ton of features. Lok Lok Price: Free with in-app purchases DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYLok Lok is different from most lock screen apps. It's almost kind of a mash-up of a lock screen and Snapchat. Turning on the device will open your camera. You can take a picture, draw on that picture, and then send it to your friends or loved ones. They'll see the image when they unlock their phone next and can respond accordingly. It's not great for sending risque pictures, but it's excellent for reminding someone to grab milk on their way home from work. The app is free to use. There are in-app purchases for things like sticker packs. Next Lock Screen Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYNext Lock Screen is Microsoft's foray into the lock screen apps space. It bills itself as a lock screen for professionals. It features the usual fair like notifications, custom unlock methods, calendar appointments, and weather.

It's not the most secure lock screen out there. However, it's really good for people who have lots of stuff to do. Picturesque Lock Screen Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYMicrosoft actually released two lock screen apps. This one is called Picturesque. This one boasts an ever-revolving lock screen wallpaper. It grabs backgrounds from Bing similar to Windows 10 lock screens. There are some other features as well. They include a search bar, various tools like camera and flashlight, and it's compatible with Bing Rewards. Many of its features cater specifically to Indian audiences. However, those not in India can just turn those features off. Only five more apps to go!

It isn't the most customizable lock screen. It will definitely show you who's been trying to peep at your info. Smart Lock Screen apps Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAYSmart Lock Screen is the name of a developer on Google Play. As you may have guessed, the developer makes lock screen apps. They're actually fairly simple. They consist of a PIN lock with a variety of themes behind them. The animations are nice, but otherwise it's just a simple lock screen.

Do you know anyone who has a well-defined sense of what their values and goals are in life and are highly committed to making them happen? If so, you that person has reached identity achievement. Learn more about identity achievement from this lesson and test your knowledge with a quiz. James Marcia and Identity James Marcia is a Canadian developmental psychologist who is known for his theory of identity development. Following up on Erik Erikson's concepts of identity crisis and identity confusion, Marcia believes that there are 4 processes that adolescents can go through as they develop their identity. Marcia called these processes identity statuses. An adolescent's identity status depends on two conditions: If the adolescent is actively searching for, or exploring, their identity, and if the adolescent is dedicated to, or made a commitment to, any personal values or beliefs. Marcia's four identity statuses are: Identity Diffusion: Adolescents have not yet attempted to find their identity, nor do they have a clear picture of what their identity may be. They have not set any goals for themselves. Identity diffusion is characterized by low commitment and low exploration. Identity Foreclosure: Adolescents have blindly accepted and committed to values and beliefs taught to them by their family, community, or significant others without exploring alternatives. They do not question the values that were taught to them. Identity foreclosure is characterized by high commitment and low exploration. Identity Moratorium: Adolescents are actively experiencing a crisis which has led them to explore their identity and values. However, they have not yet committed to any values or beliefs and are instead experimenting. Identity moratorium is characterized by low commitment and high exploration. Identity Achievement: After a process of active exploration, adolescents have made a strong commitment to a highly developed set of beliefs and values. Identity achievement is characterized by high commitment and high exploration. These four statuses are not sequential. For example, an adolescent may begin at the identity diffusion status and jump right into identity achievement. Though all adolescents will eventually experience at least one of the four identity statuses, they do not have to go through all four statuses. So what does identity achievement in adolescence look like? Example of Identity Achievement Adolescents at the identity achievement stage have actively explored and examined different values and beliefs and have finally chosen those that are most important to them. They are able to sort out who they want to be and what their life's purpose is. They realize what their priorities are. These adolescents are also confident and positive that they chose the right values and beliefs. Let's take Sally, for example. Sally's parents and grandparents are both medical doctors, and as college students they all went to the same medical school. Ever since she can remember, Sally's parents have always told her that she was going to be a surgeon. Although Sally thought the world of her parents, she did not think that she wanted to spend all of her time caring for sick people. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.
